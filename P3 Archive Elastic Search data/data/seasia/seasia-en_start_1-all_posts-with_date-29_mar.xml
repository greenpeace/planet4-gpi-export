	Greenpeace is an independent global campaigning organization that acts to change attitudes and behavior, to protect and conserve the environment and to promote peace by:
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protecting the world's ancient forests and the animals, plants and people that depend on them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Catalysing an energy revolution to address the number one threat facing our planet: climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Campaigning for sustainable agriculture by rejecting genetically-engineered organisms, protecting biodiversity and encouraging socially responsible farming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a toxic free future with safer alternatives to hazardous chemicals in today's products and manufacturing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defending our oceans by challenging wasteful and destructive fishing, and creating a global network of marine reserves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace began in 1971 when a concerned group of individuals protested against US nuclear testing off the west coast of Alaska.  The courage and commitment of the first Greenpeace activists, and the non-violent nature of their protest, set an example which thousands of people have since followed as part of a shared mission to bring about&lt;br&gt; a cleaner, greener and more peaceful planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a global organization, Greenpeace focuses on the most crucial worldwide threats to our planet's biodiversity and environment.  Since our inception we have been successful in campaigning to reverse environmental degradation by 'bearing witness' to environmental destruction and exposing and confronting environmental abuse.  Greenpeace research, investigations, information campaigns, lobby efforts and solutions work have been vital in informing policies by governments and changes in business practices to tackle environment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Southeast Asia was established in 2000 with headquarters in Thailand and offices in the Philippines and Indonesia following the first visit of the Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior to the region during the “Toxic-Free Asia Tour.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years of environmental investigations, scientific research, reports and lobbying efforts marked with dramatic, non-violent direct actions have propelled our campaigns to bring about critical change in attitudes of government and corporations and have helped us achieve important victories in our campaign to protect the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could not have done this without the enthusiasm and commitment of our individual donors, supporters, volunteers, and a wide range of allies from grassroots movements and international NGOs, who have shared our vision of positive change for a better world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPSEA Vision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Greenpeace is the leading environmental campaign organization in Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We are trusted, effective and, through “glocal” campaigning, relevant to the people and communities we work with. Our work to expose environmental problems and promote solutions is having a positive impact. And, together with our active supporter base and the wider movement, we are successfully building a sustainable and peaceful future for the people in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenpeace Mission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organization which uses non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental problems, and to force the solutions which are essential to a green and peaceful future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Greenpeace’s goal is to ensure the ability of the earth to nurture life in all its diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Therefore, Greenpeace seeks to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Protect biodiversity in all its forms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Prevent pollution and abuse of the earth’s ocean, land, air and fresh water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;End all nuclear threats&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;Promote peace, global disarmament and non-violence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our core values are reflected in our environmental campaign work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We 'bear witness' to environmental destruction in a peaceful, non-violent manner.  We use non-violent confrontation to raise the level and quality of public debate.  In exposing threats to the environment and finding solutions we have no permanent allies or adversaries.  We ensure our financial independence from political or&lt;br&gt; commercial interests.  We seek solutions to environmental dilemmas and promote open, informed debate about society's environmental choices.  And in developing our campaign strategies and policies we take great care to reflect our fundamental respect for democratic principles, and to seek solutions that will promote global social equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our funding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The support of individual donors is the backbone of our organization and is invaluable in our efforts to protect the environment.  In order to maintain absolute independence Greenpeace does not accept money from companies, governments or political parties.  Based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Greenpeace has 2.8 million individual supporters worldwide - of which 48,000 are from Southeast Asia - and national as well as regional offices in 41 countries across Asia and the Pacific, Europe, Africa and the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our offices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Southeast Asia was established in March 2000 in Thailand and in the Philippines where it has had campaigning presence since 1998. The third office in the network was opened in Indonesia in 2005.  In Indonesia, Greenpeace campaigns to bring about an Energy Revolution, and to protect Indonesian forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenpeace exists because this fragile earth deserves a voice. It needs solutions. It needs change. It needs action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace has been present in Southeast Asia since 2000. Southeast Asia's forests, mountains, rivers and oceans are home to millions of people and thousands of species of trees, plants, birds and mammals. But today, much of these flora and fauna are under threat from climate change, deforestation, pollution and unsustainable industrialized agriculture. The region's rapid industrialization and economic success come at a heavy price.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Thailand is on the brink of making real progress towards the elimination of destructive fishing and human rights abuses in its seafood supply chains. As a potential yellow card delisting from the European Commission looms, it remains to be seen whether the country will take the steps needed to fully meet the standards to eliminate human rights abuse in the seafood industry.  

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-thailand/PageFiles/697590/yellow-card.jpg" alt="Thai fishing vessel and crew" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s fair to say that Thai authorities have made progress in key areas, including reforms to the legal and regulatory framework for fishing that was drawn up in 1947, along with improvements to and enforcement of labor regulations. At the UN Ocean Conference in New York this year, Thai delegates announced a voluntary commitment to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing by rigorously controlling, monitoring, and inspecting all Thai-flagged fishing vessels operating inside and outside Thai waters. A key piece of this commitment is to eliminate all IUU fishing in Thai fishing fleets by 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understandably, this progress has been met with criticism, seen by some as insufficient and cosmetic. It remains to be seen how and whether the commitments will translate to real action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key question is whether these reforms will help Thailand to remove the worst offenders from the water and result in a net positive impact for oceans and people, relieving some of the environmental pressure from overfishing and destructive fishing that helps to drive forced labor and illegal fishing. Product traceability and transparency in procurement are also vital pieces of combatting seafood fraud and the laundering of fish caught through IUU fishing and forced labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government regulations can only be effective if industry actually gets on board and heeds the call to reduce the impact of its operations on ocean life, support fisheries and aquaculture operations working to be part of the solution, and eliminate, once and for all, deplorable practices from its supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-thailand/community_images/23/34623/112381_185026.jpg" alt="fisherman at dusk" width="600" height="408"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a global Greenpeace campaign and extensive dialogue, the world’s largest tuna company— Thai Union— recently agreed to a comprehensive set of reforms to help transform its supply chains. In doing so, the company also sent a strong signal to the broader tuna sector and seafood industry that the destructive and socially irresponsible status quo must come to an end. If Thai Union acts on its commitments, by 2020, workers will have contracts that comply with the International Labour Organization's 188 convention- an employment contract in a language they can understand, and they’ll be able to report if that contract is breached at sea or in port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thai seafood industry needs changes beyond Thai Union’s positive steps. All progressive companies must seek and champion solutions to the problems that have long riddled this industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other seafood giants in Thailand, across Asia, and around the globe whose businesses are disproportionately impacting our ocean ecosystems, and continuing to profit off labor abuse. The sheer volume of marine life that moves through the supply chains of these companies and the numerous people who bring that seafood to consumers warrant comprehensive and strong procurement policies that help reduce the ecological impact, ensure the health of fish populations, safeguard vulnerable species and habitats, respect labor and human rights, and protect the overall health of our oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow cards from the EU have proven to be strong incentives for other countries to combat illegal fishing. It must translate to meaningful action for Thailand as well. Private, public and third party stakeholders, both inside and outside of the country, have a responsibility to work together to ensure that only sustainably- and ethically-produced Thai seafood reaches shelves, freezers, sushi bars, and cat bowls around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tara Buakamsri is the Country Director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia- Thailand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	PORT KLANG, Malaysia, 2 June 2018 – After a colorful 5-month journey across Southeast Asia, the Greenpeace ship the Rainbow Warrior finally made its way to Port Klang in Selangor to raise greater awareness on environmental protection and to engage with local partners and supporters for a meaningful action on plastic pollution.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The most iconic of all the Greenpeace fleet, the Rainbow Warrior is in the region campaigning on various environmental issues affecting communities and vital ecosystems in Southeast Asia. She visited and had public events in the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and, most recently, Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time that the Greenpeace ship is sailing to Malaysia, a year after the international environmental NGO opened a local office in Kuala Lumpur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are hoping to work with the government and the people of Malaysia in raising awareness and educating the public on matters related to climate change, plastic pollution, deforestation, energy systems and systemic problems that reinforce these environmental issues, like corruption and short-sighted industry mindsets,” said Naderev “Yeb” Saño, Greenpeace Southeast Asia Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Greenpeace, the decision to establish a physical presence in Malaysia was due to the country’s strong stance and support of several international environmental treaties. Malaysia is a party to more than 10 multi-lateral agreements, which complement and reinforce its commitment to sustainable development and environmental protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is much work to be done especially with regard to plastic pollution,” Saño stressed. In a recent study by Science Magazine, Malaysia was named “the 8th worst country in the world for plastic waste producing almost 1 million tonnes of mismanaged plastic waste in 2010, but other Southeast Asian nations are no better, with Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam in the top five of the same list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While we are encouraged by the recent plastic ban in Malaysian Federal territories like Putrajaya and Kuala Lumpur, we need to take more proactive steps toward curbing plastic waste. It is time to put an end to the issue of plastic pollution – one of the Malaysia's most pressing environmental problems,” Saño added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Willcox, Captain of the Rainbow Warrior supports the statement for change when he commented, “People need to take collective action through long-term solutions. Problems like plastic pollution, deforestation, or climate change are not confined to national borders. It affects everyone and anyone on this planet. This is why the tour is happening and this is why we are in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia. The Rainbow Warrior is a symbol of hope and solidarity for a better world, and it is our wish that in Malaysia we can help spread this message.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an array of activities on schedule, Greenpeace aims to introduce itself to the wider Malaysian audience by showcasing both global and local work on plastic waste. The organisation hopes to achieve sustainable and impactful change by partnering with government, corporations, NGOs and civil society at large.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Greenpeace hopes to work collectively with all sectors of society, and we look forward to what all countries - including Malaysia - can do towards a green and peaceful future,” Saño concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ship is anchored-at-sea in Port Klang from June 2- 5, and will welcome prominent public figures, NGOs, and supporters from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

	Each year that World Water Day is celebrated, we get an opportunity to focus global attention on the importance of water and the need to ensure that this seriously imperilled resource is sustainably managed.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.unwater.org/worldwaterday/about-world-water-day/world-water-day-2014-water-and-energy/en/"&gt;This year’s World Water Day theme&lt;/a&gt; addresses the critical dependencies between water and energy usage, also known as the “water-energy nexus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most urgent cross-cutting challenges facing the world today—which is intrinsically linked with the need for more energy— is water stress and scarcity. The energy sector relies heavily on the use and availability of water for many of its core processes. Water is required in the mining and transport of fuels, in their conversion to energy and in the cooling of power plants. On the other side of the equation, massive amounts of energy are also required to pump, treat and transport water to various consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Southeast Asia, a region challenged by the rising incidence of drought and water scarcity, the water-energy nexus should be a matter of grave concern to its policy and decision makers. As population and urbanization rates go up, overall demand for water will continue to increase. Demand patterns will likewise change as the industrial sector expands and increases its water uptake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy consumption in Southeast Asia has been rising continuously during the last decade. Thermo-electric power plants are particularly thirsty, accounting for the majority of water use by the energy sector. Compared to gas-fired power plants, coal-fired power stations consume two times more water per unit of energy produced. In contrast, renewable energy systems like wind and solar PV consume minimal water and are considered as the most water-efficient forms of electricity production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of coal’s bigger water footprint are distressing, especially in the light of the World Resources Institute’s Global Coal Risk Assessment report, which states that more than 65,000 MW of new coal-fired power plants are being proposed across Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal-fired power plants contribute to water stress at every stage of the coal lifecycle and beyond: from coal mining to the burning of fuel for electricity, to emissions and coal ash disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toxic contamination of fresh water bodies is also a serious problem associated with coal. For example, coal mining, considered to be a key driver for the Indonesian economy, has largely ignored the systematic despoliation and pollution of the country’s freshwater resources. Since much vegetation cover is lost in open-pit coal mines, the soil is less able to absorb and retain water leading to increased incidence of flooding, which with toxic mining run-off has contaminated nearby streams and rivers. Such is the case of the Mahakam River situated in the town of Samarinda, East Kalimantan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Philippines, the country’s coal-fired power plants with a combined installed capacity of 4,900 MW are estimated to have a total freshwater withdrawal of more than 604 million liters of water per hour. Every hour, this amount of water can fill up 242 Olympic-sized swimming pools! (The computation is based on estimates from the United States National Energy Technological Laboratory for approximating freshwater needs for thermo-electric generation.) Moreover, the discarded water used to cool the power plant also carries with it much of the waste heat, disrupting marine or water ecosystems and affecting fisheries in its wake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Thailand, community testimonials abound relating to the severe water pollution caused by emissions coming from Mae Moh’s 2,625-MW coal behemoth. In fact, back in 2003, the State Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning Office found high levels of arsenic, chromium and manganese in almost all water sources within the vicinity of the plant. As a result, a Thai provincial court recently ordered the power plant operators to compensate villagers for crop damages caused by the coal facility. This compensation is a clear recognition of coal’s direct and deleterious effects on people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more insidious, carbon emissions due to coal burning contribute to climate change and the spawning of extreme weather events, which include unusual and prolonged occurrences of drought. These effects are already widely felt and experienced in many parts of Southeast Asia. Recent reports indicate that the drought currently affecting parts of Southeast Asia may be worse than previous episodes especially in an anticipated El Nino year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia can no longer afford to ignore nor sidestep the strong links between water and energy, and business-as-usual approaches being pursued by governments in the region regarding energy choices and water provision must be questioned. The fact that superior and alternative approaches exist, especially those anchored on the massive development and uptake of renewable energy – means that our choices need not be limited to those where water security is inevitably sacrificed at the altar of a carbon-intensive economy. We need real solutions that transcend such challenges and allow us to leap frog to a truly green, robust and resilient economic future.&lt;/p&gt;

	Bangkok- Greenpeace Southeast Asia activists gathered at Thai Union headquarters today, delivering petition signatures representing over 680,000 people calling on the company to step forward as a leader for more sustainable and socially responsible tuna. 
 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Activists and consumers have pushed for progress from Thai Union and its brands for years, and now is the time for the company to step forward and commit to real changes,” said Greenpeace Global Seafood Markets Project Leader Graham Forbes. “We are delivering these petition signatures on behalf of people around the world who demand action. Thai Union can be the company to help move the destructive tuna industry in a better direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To draw public attention to the issue, 20 activists, representing petition signatories in over 130 countries and territories, dressed up in tuna costumes and ran almost 4 kilometers from the National Stadium of Thailand in Central Bangkok to Thai Union’s headquarters to symbolically “pass the torch” for the company to make changes that would help protect workers at sea, and reduce overfishing, illegal fishing and the negative impacts on marine life from destructive fishing practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relay run represented the journey consumers and activists from around the globe have taken in urging the seafood giant to commit to positive changes for our oceans and workers at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists met with Dr. Darian McBain, Group Director of Sustainable Development for Thai Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Following almost two years of Greenpeace campaigning, we’re urging Thai Union to utilize more sustainable fishing methods rather than destructive ones to help curb rampant overfishing and the needless killing of vulnerable marine life in the tuna industry," said Anchalee Pipattanawattanakul, Oceans campaigner for Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Thai Union must do more to eliminate the risk of human rights and labor abuses in its supply chains by addressing problematic practices like transshipment at sea, which enables vessels to stay at sea for months or years at a time, keeping workers away from watchful eyes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace’s global campaign against Thai Union focuses on addressing the company’s reliance on destructive &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/world/outlaw-ocean-thailand-fishing-sea-slaves-pets.html?_r=1"&gt;fishing practices&lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.ap.org/explore/seafood-from-slaves/ap-investigation-slaves-may-have-caught-the-fish-you-bought.html"&gt;improving conditions for workers&lt;/a&gt; in its global supply chains. Greenpeace’s proposed changes to the company’s sourcing policies and practices would push Thai Union beyond the industry status quo and towards real and meaningful changes for marine life and seafood industry workers. Greenpeace's Thai Union campaign is part of a larger multi-year effort to transform the tuna industry and ensure the long-term health of tuna stocks, other marine life, and ocean ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, industry giants Mars and Nestlé &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/press/releases/2017/Mars-Nestle-commit-to-clean-up-pet-food-supply-chains-increasing-pressure-on-Thai-Union-to-act/"&gt;announced that they will take steps to ensure their pet food supply chains are free of human rights abuses and illegally caught seafood&lt;/a&gt;, increasing pressure on Thai Union. The tuna company owns brands such as Chicken of the Sea, Petit Navire, Sealect, and John West in countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

	Manila, Philippines – Environment groups that had come together in Palawan to oppose the planned Nickelodeon-branded undersea theme park in Coron scored a victory with the announcement by Viacom International Media Networks (VIMN) on Tuesday, August 22, 2017, that it will discontinue its partnership with Coral World Park (CWP) for the planned theme park.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The groups had rallied with Palawan residents, nature tourism advocates, indigenous peoples organizations, and other concerned groups, through an effort via the petition website, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://bataris.org.ph/" target="_blank"&gt;Bataris.org.ph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The petition was able to garner more than a quarter of a million signatures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bataris&lt;/em&gt; petitioner and Save Philippine Seas executive director Anna Oposa said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We commend Viacom International Media Networks, the media company that owns Nickelodeon, for heeding to the call of over 260,000 online petitioners and local communities to disengage with Coral World Park. VIMN’s decision to cut-off its ties with CWP shows that the real power lies in the hands of the people, especially our Tagbanua brothers and sisters, who fiercely opposed the project. As a child-friendly and family-oriented channel, Nickelodeon is best not to be associated with a potentially destructive structure that will negatively affect the lives, livelihood, and culture of the people of Coron.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Environmental Legal Assistance Center Palawan’s executive director, Atty. Gerthie Mayo-Anda, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“However, the battle is not yet over, and we cannot be complacent. We will continue to oppose the proposed project of Coral World Park, and for future investors not to risk their money and their name on questionable and destructive projects. We continue to call on the local government of Coron, the provincial government of Palawan, and the national government agencies, especially the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Department of Tourism, to reject the attraction. We remain vigilant and will continue to monitor any updates and developments related to the proposed project.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vince Cinches, Oceans and Political Campaigner of Greenpeace Southeast Asia – Philippines, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Let this be a warning to big companies that environmentally destructive projects, such as the proposed undersea attraction, will never be welcome in Palawan, and in any other islands in the Philippines.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposition to the proposed underwater theme park is spearheaded by Save Philippine Seas, Greenpeace Southeast Asia - Philippines, Marine Wildlife Watch of the Philippines, Environmental Legal Assistance Center Palawan, Tagbanua Tribe of Coron Island Association, Social Action Center of the Apostolic Vicariate of Taytay, Palawan, Scubasurero, World Wide Fund for Nature Philippines, Conservation International – Philippines, Oceana Philippines, Haribon Foundation for the Conservation of Natural Resources, Inc., Green Thumb Coalition, Reef Check Philippines, Center for Energy, Ecology and Development, Tambuyog Development Center Inc., NGOs for Fisheries Reform, Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement, and the Large Marine Vertebrates Research Institute Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

	When Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest storms ever recorded, slammed into the city of Tacloban in the Philippines on November 2013, Naderev "Yeb" Saño knew it was no ordinary typhoon. In fact, typhoons have now become more devastating, boosted by warmer oceans caused by climate change. And what drives climate change? Fossil fuel companies, also known as the big polluters, are primarily to blame for causing the climate crisis that the world now faces. And the disaster in Tacloban was painful for Saño and it has changed him a big way.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/Global/seasia/Philippines/Yeb%20close%20up.jpg" alt="8/9 2014, Svalbard.UN climate commissioner Yeb Saño from the Philippines is sailing with Greenpeace to the Arctic Ocean to put the spotlight on climate change around the time of the sea ice minimum." width="800" height="534"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I almost lost my brother, AG,  to the storm. He was in Tacloban during that time, visiting relatives and friends. He was supposed to live in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/giving-voice-to-vulnerable/blog/57944/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Joanna Sustento&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s brother’s house. For some reason, he stayed at another place and survived. And several years after the typhoon, AG still cannot sleep in a dark room. He still can see images of dead bodies. While searching for his friend, he held at least 73 dead bodies,” Saño recalls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yeb Saño, now the Executive Director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia, was then the Philippines' climate negotiator who was in Peru to attend the UN climate talks. It was during this time when when Typhoon Haiyan battered his beloved province of Tacloban, killing more than 6,000 people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“At that moment, I felt the least I can do was to sympathise with them by going on a fast for two weeks. Typhoon Haiyan was a life-changing moment for me, like Joanna who lost her family immediately to the storm. It changed us in a way that we now dedicate our lives to fight for communities heavily impacted by climate change. We will not stop until we hold these fossil fuel companies accountable. To do this work, I needed to step out of government and work with civil societies instead. I know that it's a tough road ahead, but I know that the journey will be a meaningful one,” says Saño.&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/Global/seasia/Philippines/Yeb%20in%20Tacloban.jpg" alt="Yeb Sano during a candle ceremony in Tacloban for Typhoon Haiyan victims." width="800" height="533"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The science is clear: pollution from fossil fuel companies drives climate change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/28/shell-knew-oil-giants-1991-film-warned-climate-change-danger"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Big polluters have known for decades that the burning of fossil fuels could lead to catastrophic climate impacts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, but they chose to hide this fact and to undermine climate science and action. They knew that the climate change has to do with the future of their business which has led to more climate impacts to vulnerable countries like the Philippines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"These companies know that they have capacity to stop but still do their business. For me that is injustice- big companies profit by fuelling climate change at the expense of people and the planet,” Saño explains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/Global/seasia/Philippines/Typhoon%20Haiyan%20damage.jpg" alt="A man sifts thru rubbles looking for salvageable items in Tacloban City after it was hit by super typhoon Haiyan last Saturday." width="800" height="533"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-philippines/What-we-do/Demand-Climate-Justice/Holding-the-big-carbon-polluters-accountable-for-climate-change/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;That is why Greenpeace is calling for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Climate Justice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to hold these big polluters accountable for their lion's share of greenhouse gas emissions responsible for catastrophic climate change. This is why companies and governments are being asked to keep fossil fuels in the ground and to shift all their investments to clean and safe renewable energy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The world has realised that renewable energy is vital in the fight against climate change. It is also clear that humanity must come together to overcome greed, arrogance, and apathy.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Greed is extreme sense of wanting more. Arrogance is believing that you know better than nature, even God. Apathy is believing if you destroy or damage vital ecosystems, someone else will fix it. This is how the fossil fuel industry operates. It’s now upon them to use their tremendous resources and shift their business models to ensure that they do no harm to people and the environment. After all, there is no planet B,” Saño concludes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	New York– As the first round of UN negotiations towards a historic UN Ocean Treaty draws to a close, Dr Sandra Schoettner of Greenpeace’s global ocean sanctuaries campaign, said: 

“Oceans beyond national borders cover almost half of our planet and belong to us all. For the first time in history, this shared responsibility could be enshrined in law with a Global Ocean Treaty. Over the past two weeks of these negotiations it’s been fantastic to see many countries from Africa, Pacific and Caribbean islands, Latin America and Europe eager to get going with drafting the text of the treaty. They know just how acute the threats facing our oceans are and how fast they need to move to get an agreement from states by the deadline of 2020.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“But some governments are lacking in vision and ambition, like Norway, Russia, and Iceland, and it’s disappointing to see the US, Australia and New Zealand being sluggish. Our oceans are in crisis and simply can’t wait while countries drag their feet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“To safeguard wildlife, tackle climate change and ensure food security for billions of people, we need to protect at least 30% of our oceans by 2030. To achieve that, we need to see a Global Ocean Treaty which has real teeth and allows us to create a network of ocean sanctuaries around the world. The future of our oceans depends on this treaty.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Bitung North Sulawesi, Indonesia - Thirty Greenpeace activists are currently occupying a palm oil refinery belonging to Wilmar International, the world’s largest palm oil trader and supplies major brands including Colgate, Mondelez, Nestlé and Unilever. 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The refinery, which is on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, was processing palm oil from major producers that are destroying rainforests in Kalimantan and Papua, Indonesia. [1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wilmar has been promising to clean up its supply chain since 2013. Yet it is still buying palm oil from forest destroyers. It is not Greenpeace’s responsibility to police their supply chain. Wilmar should only buy palm oil from producers it can prove are clean. That is what Wilmar CEO Kuok Khoon Hong promised almost five ago," said Kiki Taufik, head of Greenpeace’s global Indonesia forests campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace team [2] includes activists and climbers from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, the UK, France and Australia. One group of  activists climbed the anchor chain of a tanker ship transporting palm oil and are preventing it from moving. Another group scaled the refinery and are painting “DIRTY” in 5 metre high letters on the storage tanks. They are accompanied by the Indonesian rock band Boomerang, who are performing their new single from the top of the storage tanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Wilmar became the first palm oil trader to adopt a ‘no deforestation, no peat, no exploitation’ policy. Last week, a &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/publication/18455/the-final-countdown-forests-indonesia-palm-oil/"&gt;Greenpeace International investigation revealed that 25 palm oil producers had cleared 130,000ha of rainforest since 2015&lt;/a&gt;. [3] Wilmar was buying from 18 of those palm oil groups; three supplied the refinery where the protest is taking place. Only a fraction of the palm oil Wilmar trades comes from its own plantations; more than 80 percent comes from other palm oil producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This refinery is loaded with Wilmar’s dirty palm oil and if we weren’t here it would be on its way to factories and supermarkets all over the world. Hundreds of thousands of consumers from all over the world have had enough of forest destruction. The message to big brands like Unilever, Nestlé and Mondelez is simple: cut Wilmar off until it can prove its palm oil is clean,’ said Yeb Sano, Executive Director at Greenpeace Southeast Asia, speaking from one of the activist boats at the palm oil refinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on Wilmar to prove it no longer sources palm oil from forest destroyers. The first step is to requiring all producer groups in its supply chain to publish mill location data and concession maps for their entire operations and to cut off any that refuse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Palm oil impacts on environment, people and climate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wilmar International and other palm oil groups are regularly &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/11/palm-oil-global-brands-profiting-from-child-and-forced-labour/"&gt;accused of exploiting workers, children and local communities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The plantation sector - palm oil and pulp - is the single largest driver of deforestation in Indonesia. Around 24 million hectares of rainforest was destroyed in Indonesia between 1990 and 2015, according to official figures released by the Indonesian government.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deforestation and peatland destruction are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to climate change. This has pushed Indonesia into the &lt;a href="https://www.wri.org/blog/2017/04/interactive-chart-explains-worlds-top-10-emitters-and-how-theyve-changed"&gt;top tier of global emitters, alongside the United States of America and China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plantation development is a root cause of Indonesia’s forest and peatland fires. In July 2015, devastating blazes spread in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Papua. These fires produced a haze that affected millions of people across Southeast Asia. Researchers at Harvard and Columbia Universities estimate that the &lt;a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2016/09/smoke-from-2015-indonesian-fires-may-have-caused-100000-premature-deaths"&gt;smoke from 2015 Indonesian fires may have caused 100,000 premature deaths&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/776101467990969768/The-cost-of-fire-an-economic-analysis-of-Indonesia-s-2015-fire-crisis"&gt;The World Bank calculated the cost of the disaster at US$16bn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] The protest is taking place at Wilmar’s PT Multi Nabati Sulawesi refinery in Bitung, North Sulawesi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] The action was coordinated by Greenpeace Southeast Asia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3] Greenpeace International used satellite imagery to identify 130,000ha of deforestation by 25 producer groups since 2015. 51,600ha (40%) was in Indonesian Papua with a further 26,100ha (20%) in neighbouring Papua New Guinea - some of the most biodiverse regions on earth and until recently untouched by the palm oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Greenpeace International approached Wilmar about these producer groups, it confirmed that it was sourcing from 18 of the producer groups. It subsequently stopped sourcing from several of the groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.wilmar-international.com/sustainability/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/180426_MNS-BTG_L2.pdf"&gt;supply chain data published by Wilmar&lt;/a&gt;, 3 of the producer groups named in the Greenpeace International investigation - Central Cipta Murdaya, Gama and the Fangiono family - supplied palm to PT Multi Nabati Sulawesi in 2017, the most recent period for which data is available.&lt;/p&gt;

	Manila — Greenpeace Southeast Asia today released its latest tuna cannery ranking evaluating 23 canneries and brands from the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia based on their policies on sustainability, transparency and equitability. In the Sea to Can: 2018 Southeast Asia Canned Tuna Ranking Report, only five canneries were identified as overall green performers:  Alliance Select Foods International (Philippines), PT International Alliance Foods Indonesia (Indonesia), PT Samudra Mandiri Sentosa (Indonesia), PT Sinar Pure Foods International (Indonesia), and Tops Supermarket (Thailand). [1]

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“After three years of proactive engagement, brands and canneries in the region are now more open and collaborative to work with Greenpeace and consumers on fixing their supply chains. But, unfortunately, they are still not transitioning swiftly enough in response to the alarming state of our oceans," said Ephraim Batungbacal, Regional Oceans Research Coordinator for Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuna continues to be the most economically valuable fish in the world.  Southeast Asian countries Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam are among the top 10 exporters of processed canned tuna, with a combined income of USD 3.016 billion. A total of USD 7 billion worth of canned tuna products was exported in 2017. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace report comes at a time when tuna stocks globally are experiencing intense pressure from destructive fishing practices and overfishing.  Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing remains rampant in this part of the world. For this reason, the European Union (EU) - one of the biggest importers of tuna from the region - issued a yellow card sanction against Thailand in 2015 and Vietnam in 2017 for failing to combat IUU, which remains in effect pending these countries’ compliance [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's tuna rankings evaluate canneries by checking the company’s performance against a seven-point criteria on their tuna sourcing practices. [4] Companies are strongly encouraged to favor and source tuna from lower-impact fishing methods including pole and line, handline, troll or Fish Aggregating Devices (FAD) free purse seining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, there were notable improvements in the sector, specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More companies now have tighter policies on traceability and sustainability, resulting in increased procurement of sustainably caught tuna, with 11 companies sourcing using pole and line, and 11 companies sourcing FAD-free purse seine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heightened awareness of issues on slavery at sea and improved measures to avoid inadvertently sourcing tuna associated with human rights and labor abuse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumers now have access to more product information, with improved labelling at the point of sale for the public to identify the species and how tuna is caught.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constructive dialogue with major tuna companies through regular communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, it is important to note that the Philippines and Indonesia continue to catch juvenile Yellowfin and Bigeye tuna at 20-50 cm in length, usually by a fleet of purse seiners. [5] If juvenile fishing is not addressed, this will impact the health condition of tuna stocks and the marine ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some canneries also have a “double standard” approach to product disclosure, exercising more or less stringent rules depending on the country of destination. Greenpeace calls on companies to use the same sourcing standards across the board and make product information available to all consumers regardless of where the product is sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Transparency is key. While we appreciate constructive dialogue with these regional canneries, we would like to see accountability and responsibility from these regional canneries towards consumers here in Southeast Asia. If they have nothing to hide, then a substantial disclosure about their products is necessary,” added Batungbacal.&lt;/p&gt;

	Manila, Philippines, 11 December 2018. – A day after International Human Rights Day, the landmark investigation looking into the responsibility of 47 coal, oil, gas and cement companies for human rights violations suffered by the Filipino people, is back home in the Philippines to conclude in a two-day hearing with more testimonies from human rights advocates and from the climate frontlines.  The last two of five hearings were conducted in New York and London with international scientific and, legal experts, and Filipino survivors of various extreme weather events from the U.S., the U.K. and the Philippines, such as Haiyan, Mangkhut, Ondoy and Katrina. 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;If successful, the inquiry could result in the first legal finding of corporate responsibility for human rights violations in the age of the climate crisis. Greenpeace South-East Asia, Amnesty International, Oxfam International, and typhoon survivors are among the witnesses who will testify at the sixth and final hearings, which take place on 11-12 December, a day after the&lt;a href="http://standup4humanrights.org/en/index.html"&gt; 70&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;.[1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a lifelong human rights and social justice campaigner, it is clear to me that you cannot talk about the climate change crisis without recognizing that it is also an inequality and discrimination issue,” said Kumi Naidoo Secretary General of Amnesty International, who will be speaking at the hearing. “While this is the final chapter in the investigation, it is the beginning of a new global movement of communities demanding protection of their human rights from the climate crisis and accountability of those responsible for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, Total, BHP Billiton and Suncor are among the&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-philippines/press/releases/Worlds-largest-carbon-producers-ordered-to-respond-to-allegations-of-human-rights--abuses-from-climate-change/The-Climate-Change-and-Human-Rights-Petition/"&gt; 47 carbon majors that are being investigated&lt;/a&gt; by the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines. The national inquiry is the&lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/15575/landmark-human-rights-hearings-against-fossil-fuel-companies-begin-in-the-philippines/"&gt; world’s first human rights investigation&lt;/a&gt; into corporate responsibility for climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the filing of the petition in 2015 and five public inquiry hearings held throughout this year, all of the companies have so far failed to show up and meaningfully participate. Initially, the companies fought to get the investigation dismissed, but the communities prevailed after the Commission determined in December 2017 that it had the authority to conduct the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This investigation is becoming a depository of evidence on fossil fuel denial and deceit. Thousands of pages of statements and evidence are now on the record, and the public will be able to see why we are facing worsening heat waves, wildfires, floods, droughts, and storms. More importantly, who are primarily responsible,” said Yeb Saño, Executive Director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia and a petitioner who will also testify at the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The refusal by these carbon majors to appear at any of the public hearings is yet another example of a breach in these companies’ corporate responsibility and respect for human rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 has been a landmark year in global climate litigation. Impacted people and U.S. cities, counties, and two states are seeking to hold oil, gas, and coal companies accountable over climate change. Recently, the Pacific island nation,&lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/19477/vanuatu-warns-fossil-fuel-companies-could-be-sued-over-climate-change/"&gt; Vanuatu&lt;/a&gt;, announced it is looking into options to sue the world’s most polluting fossil fuel corporations and countries facilitating the industry for their roles in creating catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public hearings serve as a platform for communities on the frontlines of climate impacts to share their stories of the harms they are suffering, the risks they face, and why they are seeking climate justice.[3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The storm changed our lives. I lost my parents and two brothers, and had to support myself and my siblings who survived through it. I speak not only to share my story, but also on behalf of vulnerable communities who experience the tremendous losses that we suffer through storms like Sendong,” said Honeylyn Gonzales, survivor of 2011’s Typhoon Washi (Filipino name Sendong), which caused more than 1,000 casualties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final hearing also takes place during the mid-way point of COP 24 and less than two months after the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) delivered an alarming assessment on the&lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/18839/ipcc-report-points-to-stark-choices-ahead-but-reason-for-hope-and-action-greenpeace/"&gt; massive and urgent task needed to limit global warming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petitioners anticipate that the Commission will issue a report and resolution in mid-2019.[4]&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta- Under strong pressure from its customers and civil society, Malaysian palm oil company FELDA Global Ventures (FGV) has promised to restore over 1,000 hectares of the peat forest in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. [1] This is the first time that a palm oil company has been forced to restore rainforest and peatland in order to remain a supplier to the global market.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;FGV is a subsidiary of FELDA, the world’s largest palm oil grower. Despite adopting a sustainability policy in August 2016, FGV continued clearing forest and developing peatlands into May 2017. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bagus Kusuma, forest campaigner with Greenpeace Southeast Asia, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “Corporate ‘no deforestation’ policies are finally starting to bite. This is the first time a palm oil company has been forced by its customers to restore the forest it cleared. It sends a serious warning that other destructive palm oil companies should heed: deforestation has consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Making commitments is the easy part. FELDA must now draw up and implement a time-bound action plan to deliver on today’s promises. Companies should wait for credible proof that restoration is underway before resuming purchases. FELDA must also speed up its efforts to address the exploitation of workers in its Malaysian plantations and recertify its palm oil mills with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forest clearance and peatland development is widely acknowledged as a root cause of forest fires in Indonesia. West Kalimantan, where FGV operates, was one of the most affected areas during the 2015 fires crisis and is once again under a state of emergency following serious outbreaks of fire. [3]&lt;/p&gt;

	When people look at the oceans some only see deep blue water. Others only see fish and the bounty underneath the surface. But there are many, like Captain Peter "Pete" Wilcox who see the sea for what it truly is- a living, breathing, thriving ecosystem meant to be preserved- and even devote themselves, even risk their own lives, to protect it.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Pete Willcox on the RW" src="/seasia/Global/seasia/seasia/Pete%20at%20the%20bridge.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="532"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went aboard the iconic ship the Rainbow Warrior during a recent stopover in Thailand to meet Pete who has sailed the longest distance with Greenpeace and to talk about the need for environmental activism in this day and age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pete: I joined Greenpeace in 1981 after spending seven years doing environmental work, primarily on the Clearwater ship in New York. The reason I joined Greenpeace was because I was very attracted to the use of non-violent direct action to achieve social change. I have some experience in the US civil rights movement and I knew from that experience how important it is to do things non-violent. Hurting people may work in a war, but we are not in a war. We try to change people’s minds and you can’t use violence to change people’s minds. That doesn’t work. Greenpeace has always had a very strong stance against any kind of violence. And I think that it is important that we still do that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On land and at sea, the practice of peaceful protest is strictly observed by Greenpeace staff and volunteers.  Pete proudly says that no other environmental organisation with ships does peaceful protests the way Greenpeace does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, on July 10, 1985, the Rainbow Warrior was the target of a violent attack while moored in Auckland, New Zealand. Pete remembers that night very well. At close to midnight, while most of the crew were already asleep, a deafening sound jolted everyone onboard, followed by another. In an instant, the lights went out and water rushed in forcing Pete and the others to leap out of the sinking ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Bombing of the RW" src="/seasia/Global/seasia/seasia/Bombing%20of%20the%20RW.jpg" alt="Bombing of the RW" width="800" height="533"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crew mate Fernando Pereira wasn't so lucky. The Portuguese photographer instantly perished. Fernando joined the Greenpeace mission to protest against French nuclear testing in the South Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the French government was blamed for the attack which prompted public outcry from all corners of the world, making it known to governments and corporations that ‘You can't sink a Rainbow’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="RW commemoration in Paris" src="/seasia/Global/seasia/seasia/RW%20commemoration%20in%20Paris.jpg" alt="RW commemoration in Paris" width="800" height="532"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bombing of the Rainbow Warrior was a life-changing experience for Pete, and it made him more determined to sail with purpose and fight for environmental protection and social justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The ships bring us to places nobody else can go. Whether it is the Antarctic or the middle of the ocean. We need ships to do some of the campaigns we work on.” Pete said. Years after that tragic night in Auckland, ships like the Rainbow Warrior continue to be instrumental in stopping environmental crimes from happening and for raising awareness on different issues. From conducting research into the effects of climate change in the Arctic, to stopping shiploads of illegal timber leaving the Amazon, to giving aid and humanitarian relief to communities devastated by a super typhoon in the Philippines, Greenpeace ships have been at the frontlines, ready to take action for people and the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="RW in Songkhla" src="/seasia/Global/seasia/seasia/RW%20in%20Songkhla.jpg" alt="RW in Songkhla" width="800" height="533"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just recently, the newest Rainbow Warrior was back to Southeast Asia for a 4-month ship tour highlighting climate change and people power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the most experienced captain with over 35 years with Greenpeace, Pete has seen many changes within the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pete: We are a bigger organisation now. There were about 200 people worldwide, now there are over 3,000. We can do much more and create bigger impact. To me that is the positive change. It would be fun to stay in a small organisation where you knew everyone but we wouldn’t have been as effective as we are today. And if you want to have something to say about the planet you need to have a strong voice. And having 3,000 people in 55 countries gives us a strong voice.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace captain thinks that one of the biggest threats to our world is the way we produce energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pete: We know that burning fossil fuels not only makes the atmosphere warmer but also makes the ocean acidic. We can’t continue to generate energy the way we are today and expect to keep our oceans. This is absolutely critical. We’ve got to stop burning fossil fuel immediately. The thing that frustrates me today is that we know from scientists what the effects of the burning fossil fuel are and we have the technology to change that. But we don’t have the political will. We have a few rich men making lots of money from fossil fuel but far as I concern, those men are selling the future of their children and grandchildren for money. They should all be in jail. They should pay the price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, Pete has this advice to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pete: We are on the brink of killing the oceans. We are on the brink of making the atmosphere so polluted that even if we don’t burn another drop of fossil fuel, we are still facing a thousand years of sea level rise. We’ve done this to ourselves. We have to do everything we can to mitigate the damage for the future of our children. That’s why I am still here. I care about children’s future. I will continue to work for the planet. I’m not perfect but I’m trying to make the change that is necessary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	New York - Greenpeace activists flew a giant turtle outside the United Nations HQ in New York this morning, as countries gathered to begin negotiations, for the first time in history, towards a treaty covering all oceans outside of national borders. The large and colorful kite, representing iconic marine life, was flown from a boat on the East River, alongside an aerial banner reading “Global Oceans – Global Treaty!” 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The negotiations are the result of a decade-long process and could conclude as early as 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fate of our oceans is in the hands of everyone in these negotiations,” &lt;strong&gt;said Dr Sandra Schoettner of Greenpeace's global ocean sanctuaries campaign&lt;/strong&gt;, speaking from outside the UN. “It's no exaggeration to say that the governments meeting today are making history as we speak. It is urgent they create a strong ocean treaty which allows us to create a global network of ocean sanctuaries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treaty is crucial because there are no global rules to protect the vast majority of the global oceans – but quite a few to exploit them. As a consequence, the oceans are being pushed to their limits by overfishing, pollution, climate change and other human activity. In the absence of a global treaty, a mere 1% of the global oceans are currently protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr Schoettner continued:&lt;/strong&gt; “Oceans beyond borders cover almost half of our planet. They belong to us all, but if we do not act now we will lose vital habitats and species before we even know what we’ve lost. Now world leaders need to show the vision to achieve the scientific imperative of protecting at least 30% of the oceans by 2030. We can only do that with a global ocean treaty which creates real protection for these waters and allows us to create a global network of ocean sanctuaries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Bangkok, Thailand - The “Teluk Patani” network, Permatamas, and Greenpeace Southeast Asia have raised concerns over the Environmental Health Impact Assessment (EHIA) of the proposed coal-fired power plant at Thepa. The groups say the project overlooks the importance of rich ecosystems, so-called “Teluk Patani”(in Malay dialect), which are vital to the culture and livelihood of the people in Songkhla and Pattani provinces.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p id="docs-internal-guid-7b521492-7f43-dd1d-86aa-a4cad2b5591a" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a public forum, entitled “Energy, Environment, and Peace: Truth to Power”, the groups urged the government to cancel the 2,200 megawatt Thepa coal project. A map of “Teluk Patani” ecosystem [1] was presented illustrating  information from field survey by communities  on the natural resources in the surrounding area of Pattani Gulf-- from Thepa district to Tachi cape-- likely to be affected by coal project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Describing the environmental integrity in Thepa district, Direk Hemnakorn of the Teluk Patani network said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Thepa, a town by an estuary, has had a long and significant history. It is abundant with natural resources that make up ecosystems of forests, mountains, paddy fields, and seas which are beautifully interconnected and alive to this day. Contrary to the definition that many have created for it, Thepa is not a stand alone town, but rather a town surrounded by many others, big and small, whether Songkhla, Chana, Nattawee, Saba Yoi, Khok Pho, Yala, Yarang, Nong Jik, or Patani.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If Thepa is damaged, other  nearby towns may be seriously affected as well. Also known as the 'Teluk Patani’, the sea of Thepa in Pattani Gulf is home to hundreds of communities and tens of thousands of fishermen who rely on it for a living. For the Thai society, it is considered an epicenter of cultural diversity. We will not allow the coal plant to destroy one of the country’s most vital food sources.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to  the Environmental Health Impact Assessment (EHIA) of the Thepa coal-fired power plant project,   there will be coal shipments of over 21,000 tons each day, or approximately 8 million tons every year from Indonesia, Australia, and South Africa. The proposed coal plant at Thepa will emit more than 12 million tons of carbon dioxide annually while producing fly ash, a contaminant of heavy metals such as mercury, lead, and arsenic, by more than 1,200 tons each day.[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Atmospheric modeling conducted by the Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group of Harvard University using a global 3D chemistry transport model (GEOS-Chem), has estimated that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;PM2.5 produced by the Thepa coal-fired power station would be projected to cause approximately 4,400 premature deaths over an operating life  span of 40 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most significant health impacts occur to the west of the proposed power plant site, as the pollution gets blown across the entire peninsula. The emissions also affect air quality in northern Sumatra and northern peninsular Malaysia, causing significant cross-border health impacts.[3].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;After the approval of the expert panel of the Office of Natural Resource and the Environmental Policy and Planning , amidst strong opposition from communities, civil society and independent academic groups, the EHIA of the Thepa coal-fired power station is currently with  the Office of National Environment Board to be later approved by the Cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chariya Senpong, Climate and Energy Campaigner of Greenpeace Southeast Asia said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Once again, we see how energy policy makers have prioritized profits of the coal industry over people and the environment. The decision to build a coal plant will prevent  energy justice, environmental protection and peace. There is no place for coal in Thailand as it undermines the goals set under the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gases emission in order to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;keep the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We must shift to renewable energy now to ensure  sustainable economic development, environmental protection, and just society.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the public forum “Energy, Environment, and Peace: Truth to Power”, the groups are calling the government to  revoke and remove  all new coal plants  from the Power Development Plan 2015-2036 (PDP2015). Furthermore, a revision process for PDP2015 that is hosted by the Ministry of Energy and the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) [4] has to take into account the framework for improving accountability and performance of power sector planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assoc. Dr. Chalee Charoenlapanoparat, Vice Chancellor at Thammasat University said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“By changing the energy models and making management plans concrete, Thailand will be able to cease its dependence on coal and stand on its own. Policymaking in energy production should be done with the cooperation of all sectors, not solely by the fossil fuel industry and groups with hidden self-interests. Various opportunities and challenges lie ahead for Thailand’s energy generation systems and networks for when the era of coal comes to an end. We must hold the people as the main priority, aiming for the true stability in the energy sector.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Notes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] Teluk Patani is an area of integral ecosystems, having served surrounding communities for long time, whether on land or in the water. It covers over 30,000 rai of wetlands, consisting of around 23,125 rai of mangrove forests which are nurseries to marine animals and conjoined with other ecosystems.

	London/Manila – Survivors of Super Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines – the deadliest storm to hit the country – are in London to give personal testimonies at a landmark inquiry to determine whether the world’s largest carbon producers are violating the human rights of communities worst affected by climate change.[1] The hearings conclude on 8 November, which is also the fifth anniversary of Typhoon Haiyan.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“You could not distinguish between the road and the dead bodies of people and animals everywhere. We feared for our safety all the time, especially during the night. We just wanted to leave Tacloban…I was traumatised,” says Marielle Bacason, a 27-year old Haiyan survivor who migrated to London to work as a research nurse when unemployment rose as a result of the event, and who will be testifying at the hearing.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “All I ask of these big companies is to allow our children, grandchildren, and future generations to be able to enjoy an unspoiled planet. I just ask that they consider the long-term effects of their actions.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The investigation by the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines is the first of its kind to be launched by an independent constitutional body. It is considering whether 47 coal, oil, gas and cement companies, including ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, and BP, endanger lives and livelihoods of Filipinos, wherever they may be situated, by knowingly contributing to the devastating impacts of climate change through carbon pollution from their products and business activities.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The investigation was triggered in 2015 by a Climate Justice and Human Rights petition filed before the Commission by representatives of communities and non-profit organisations across the Philippines. During the typhoon, which hit on 8 November 2013, thousands more than the official death toll of 6,343 are thought to have died, with millions of lives still being affected to this day.[2]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Professor Myles Allen, a coordinating Lead Author of the recent United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report will appear as an expert to discuss the attribution of recent climate change and assess what these changes mean for global climate simulations of the future and the Philippines. The IPCC has analysed mitigation pathways limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In an analysis by Greenpeace International and CoalSwarm we would require a near-total reduction in coal use for electricity generation by 2050, with reductions of approximately two-thirds by 2030.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “The probabilities of many potentially damaging extreme weather events, including heatwaves and short-duration extreme precipitation events, increase predictably with rising global temperatures,” says Myles Allen, Professor of Geosystem Science in the School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford and Head of the Climate Dynamics Group in the University’s Department of Physics. “Hence, this hearing provides a basis for relating harm associated with extreme weather events with attributable changes in global temperature.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The inquiry is part of a growing number of cases across the world, where people are applying pressure on governments and fossil fuel companies, to demand more ambitious climate action.[3]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “This landmark investigation is not just for Filipinos but for vulnerable communities everywhere,” says Desiree Llanos Dee, Campaigner at Greenpeace Southeast Asia. “We are seeing a growing global movement of people who are not just asking questions of accountability, but who are ready to stand up to big polluters largely responsible for the climate crisis.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Following the London hearing, there will be one final public inquiry in the Philippines on 11-12 December 2018. It is expected that the Commission will wrap up its investigation by the end of the year and issue its findings in early 2019.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Photo and video can be accessed &lt;a href="https://media.greenpeace.org/shoot/27MDHUHK0XZ"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes:&lt;br&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;[1] The hearings will take place at the London School of Economics between November 6-8, 2018&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [2] The official total is 6,343 fatalities with 1,058 missing, though local people have reported that Haiyan claimed more than 10,000 lives.

	JAKARTA, July 28, 2017 -Two years after devastating fires plunged Indonesia into crisis, President Joko Widodo’s  promises on forest and peat protection are being tested as forest fires break out across Indonesia and five provinces have declared states of emergency.   
 


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace analysis of the government’s own data and methodology show that fires hotspots have nearly doubled in less than three months, with 148 hotspots registered in May and 283 so far this July [1]. A new version of the moratorium was presented on Monday with no significant improvement from its previous versions, and was followed by President Jokowi urging his ministers to put regulations at the service of business.[2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annisa Rahmawati, Senior Forest Campaigner for Greenpeace Indonesia said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government hasn’t done enough and now the lack of law enforcement could restart a humanitarian catastrophe and huge economic losses for the country, as we experienced during the tragic events of 2015 that cost an estimated 100, 000 premature deaths [3] and billions to the economy [4] .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Companies benefit from poorly enforced laws in order to keep clearing forests and draining peatland, which is the main cause of the fires that are again putting children in hospitals and forcing people to leave their homes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern is also growing in neighbouring countries since Aceh region in Sumatra, is among the worst hit area and is just 750 km from Kuala Lumpur. [5]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The government keeps promising a haze-free year to its neighbouring countries [6], but it is premature to make this claim. To tackle the haze crisis, firstly we need to stop all further development on forested peatlands; secondly we must restore already drained priority areas; and finally, ensure that consistent and systematic law enforcement is put in place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indonesian government reports that in 2015 more than 2 million hectares were burnt. The link between the fires and plantation development is well documented. Greenpeace analysis shows that during the height of the crisis -1st August - 26th October- nearly 40% of fires were in identified concessions granted by the government for logging or pulp and oil palm plantations. Almost half of the fires were on peatland – wetland areas that only become vulnerable to fire when they are cleared and drained, part of the plantation development process [7].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There can be no hope for Indonesian rainforests and peatland until plantation companies demonstrate serious efforts to change their practices in order to prevent fires. If they continue this reckless destruction, fires and the toxic haze will return year after year”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	Manila - A week-long beach clean up has exposed the companies most responsible for plastic pollution after an audit of plastic waste conducted on Freedom Island, a critical wetland habitat and Ramsar site [1] spanning 30 hectares in Manila Bay - one of the worst areas for plastic pollution in the Philippines.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace Philippines and &lt;em&gt;#breakfreefromplastic&lt;/em&gt; movement audit, the first of its kind in the country, revealed that Nestlé, Unilever, and Indonesian company PT Torabika Mayora are the top three contributors of plastic waste discovered in the area, contributing to the 1.88 million metric tonnes of mismanaged plastic wastes in the Philippines per year[2]. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we throw something away, there is no ‘away’. The Philippines is the third biggest source of plastic ocean pollution because global corporations are locking us into cheap, disposable plastics, rather than innovating and finding solutions,” said Abigail Aguilar, Campaigner for Greenpeace Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These corporations are the missing piece in the global fight against plastic pollution. Citizens are burdened with the social and environmental impacts of plastic waste, rather than those that are responsible,” Aguilar added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the clean up, Greenpeace volunteers and coalition partners from the &lt;em&gt;#breakfreefromplastic&lt;/em&gt; Movement[3], found items ranging from styrofoam to footwear, along with single-use plastics such as bags, plastic bottle labels, and straws. A total of 54,260 pieces of plastic waste were collected during the audit, with most products being sachets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing countries, such as the Philippines, run on a “sachet economy”, which encourages the practice of buying Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCGs) in small quantities. This drives market and profit share for most companies by making it more accessible to people with limited incomes [4].  However, low-value single-use sachets are not collected by waste pickers and usually end up in landfills or scattered indiscriminately as litter in the streets or marine debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s time these companies stop business-as-usual and use their resources to innovate and redesign their packaging and delivery solutions,” Aguilar said. “They could for instance practice extended producer responsibility [5] where companies substitute non-reusable and non-recyclable products with new systems, such as refillables - prevention instead of end-of-pipe waste management. In the long term they’ll see this will yield strong environmental and economic benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philippines ranks as the third worst polluter into the world’s oceans, with China as number one. In a study, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia are also in the list of top 10 countries[6] with mismanaged plastic waste. While their economies are growing, this new-found spending power has led to ‘exploding demand for consumer products that has not yet been met with a commensurate waste-management infrastructure.’[7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASEAN countries, due to their lengthy coastlines and high plastic usage, are some of the primary sources of marine plastics globally. Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) estimates that the cost to the tourism, fishing and shipping industries was US$1.2 billion in the region alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace conducted the plastic waste brand audit as part of the &lt;em&gt;#breakfreefromplastic&lt;/em&gt; movement and its member organisations Mother Earth Foundation, Ecowaste Coalition, Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, and Health Care without Harm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 28 September 2017 -  Indonesia’s state-owned power company PLN, poses a financial risk to Indonesia’s state budget due to it’s over-ambitious plans to expand dirty coal plants in the Java-Bali region.


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These findings come from a  letter leaked from Indonesia’s Finance Minister, Sri Mulyani, which shows the financial condition and risk of default on PLN’s debts. It added that electricity bills needed to rise and production costs would need to fall if the company was to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"PLN has been transfixed by the idea that coal is a source of cheap energy.  But instead, its ambitious coal plans are in danger of leading the whole country into a financial black hole,” said Hindun Mulaika, Greenpeace Indonesia campaigner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Sri Mulyani's letter shows how PLN has completely misjudged electricity demand in Java-Bali. PLN thinks it will dramatically increase.  In reality it more likely to decline because of greater energy efficiency.  So PLN’s ludicrous plans for new coal-fired power plants need to be re-thought.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As recently revealed by IEEFA’s report, "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Capacity Payments to Coal-fired Power Plants could lock Indonesia into a High-Cost Electricity Future&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;", the current utilisation rate in Java-Bali is as low as 57.3%, which is barely viable. Yet PLN plans to add another 25,000 MW of coal power will lead to huge over-capacity. The cost to PLN could be US$ 76 billion for unused power generation over the next few years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The plants will either be producing electricity for which there is no market, but which PLN will have to pay for. Or they will sit idle, wasting billions of dollars of investment,” said Hindun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Someone will have to pay for this and it will either be the state, with a huge impact on budgets for other services like health or education. Or the cost will be passed on to Indonesians in the form of higher electricity prices.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace Indonesia calls on PLN to immediately review coal power plants which are in the pre-construction phase, and cancel those planned in Java-Bali under the 35,000 MW program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some coal-fired power plants are currently in the pre-construction stage such as Tanjung Jati B power plant units 5 and 6, CPP Cirebon Expansion and CPP Indramayu 2, and CPP Cilacap. Any increase in electricity demand could and should be met with renewable energies, where costs are declining rapidly making them cost competitive with coal.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace Indonesia also calls on the government to heed the lessons of China, which is facing an overcapacity of 240,00-499,000 MW and the expected loss of US $490 billion by 2020. [2]  In South Africa Eskom and its coal power mega-projects (and other major mistakes) also pushed the company into unmanageable debts. For years Eskom can only stay afloat through pumping huge amounts of money from the national Budget, the country’s pension funds, the South African Development Bank and other state connected financial institutions. All this directly or indirectly deteriorates national finances. [3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We do not want Indonesia to be in the same position,” said Hindun Mulaika.  “It is the budget allocation that is clearly wrong, when other sectors such as education and health should be the areas that get support.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Bangkok— Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s 6-month analysis of air quality levels from 19 monitoring stations in 14 cities across Thailand show high levels of toxic air pollution, PM2.5, that exceed safety limits set by the World Health Organization— one of the requirements to meet the country's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [1]. Greenpeace is urging the Pollution Control Department to immediately upgrade Thailand’s air quality index (AQI) to incorporate PM2.5 (PM2.5 AQI).

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is one of the key environmental issues that the Thai government has failed to immediately address. PM2.5 poses a serious threat to human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to State of Global Air report, in 2015, PM2.5 caused around 37,500 premature deaths in Thailand [2]. Most at risk are children and the elderly, people living in big cities and people living in areas near coal-fired power plants and polluting industries. By not setting an AQI of PM2.5, Thailand’s population in urban areas will be exposed to outdoor air pollution levels that are way above WHO limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While all of the cities sampled reached WHO air quality limits of 10 µg/m³ annual average, the data from the Pollution Control Department’s Monitoring Station also revealed that PM2.5 concentration in 10 of 14 cities failed to meet the Thai government’s own air quality standards for annual average PM2.5 concentration (25 µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between January to June this year, the two most critical cities with the highest half-year average concentrations of PM2.5 were Khon Kaen (44 µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and Saraburi (40 µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) which had over four times higher than WHO air quality limits. The other 8 cities at risk include Bangkok, Samut Prakarn, Prachinburi, Ratchaburi, Samut Sakorn, Lampang, Chiang Mai, and Tak which showed an alarming rate of an annual average PM2.5 concentration between 26-39µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is used as a marker of sustainable development and concerns about air pollution are reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).[3] Greenpeace notes that although Thailand has adopted SDGs, the government has failed to meet crucial goals, including Goal 3 that aims to “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”[4] and Goal 11 that aims to “Make cities and human settlement inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable  [5].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Millions of people are at risk if nothing is done to improve the country's air quality. The Thai government must take a decisive action to address this national health emergency and create and implement a bolder action plan that reduces pollution, cleans our air, and saves lives," said Chariya Senpong, Climate and Energy Campaigner, Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

	SAN FRANCISCO — Today, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed all claims in the controversial case that major logging company Resolute Forest Products [2] filed against Greenpeace Inc., Greenpeace Fund, and Greenpeace International, Stand.earth and individual defendants, including claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) act.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The court’s decision sends a clear message to corporations that attacks on core democratic values like freedom of speech and legitimate advocacy on issues of public interest will not be tolerated. District Judge Jon S. Tigar wrote in his order dismissing the case that “the defendants’ speech constituted the expression of opinion, or different viewpoints that [are] a vital part of our democracy.” Noting that “Greenpeace’s publications at issue rely on scientific research or fact”, the judge added that “[t]he academy, and not the courthouse, is the appropriate place to resolve scientific disagreements of this kind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolute will be allowed to amend its filing as a formality, but Greenpeace is confident that any such attempt will meet a similar fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace USA General Counsel Tom Wetterer said in response to the decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are pleased the court unequivocally threw out this attempt to abuse our legal system and silence legitimate criticism on matters of public concern. This is very positive news for all of us, for the values that we share, and for Canada’s boreal forest. Resolute’s claim that organizations and activists committed to the conservation of the forests were part of a criminal enterprise is absurd and a sad symptom of a wider assault on constitutional rights and democracy. The logging company’s allegations were a clear attempt to silence the voices that advocate for the environment. Recently, Energy Transfer Partners — the oil company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline — decided to follow a strikingly similar path &lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; under the legal wing of none other than Trump’s go-to law firm. The similarities are apparent and this underhanded playbook targeting free speech should be a cause of real concern. We’re grateful that the court has shown today it is a losing playbook, but that doesn’t mean corporate bullies like ETP won’t stop trying to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Energy Transfer’s case repackages many of the spurious allegations and legal claims made against Greenpeace by the Kasowitz firm on behalf of Resolute. The decision on the Resolute suit should be a clear indication that Energy Transfer’s case has no future. Both are classic SLAPPs, or strategic lawsuits against public participation. These cases don’t seek justice. They intend to silence free speech through expensive, time-consuming litigation. This pattern of harassment by corporate bullies led by Trump’s go-to attorneys must be stopped in its tracks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace USA Senior Forest Campaigner Daniel Brindis added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The judge’s decision to dismiss the case affirms that Resolute’s divisive and bullying tactics are a waste of time and resources. It is time for Resolute to finally work with environmental organizations including Greenpeace to address their destructive forestry operations and forge a collaborative and sustainable path forward. Instead of spending more valuable resources to amend this lawsuit, Greenpeace hopes Resolute will finally be ready to work together to find solutions. Thousands in Canada and around the world have called for the protection of the forest, it’s time for Resolute to listen to them too. The world needs a healthy boreal forest and together we can develop long term sustainable solutions that respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples, protect local communities and ensure the survival of species at risk like the Woodland Caribou. ” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2] On May 31, 2016 Resolute Forest Products filed a CAD$300 million lawsuit under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) in the United States District Court for Southern Georgia, against Greenpeace International, Greenpeace, Inc., Greenpeace Fund, Inc., STAND.earth (formerly ForestEthics), and five individual staff members of these independent organizations. The case was transferred to Northern California on May 16, 2017 when Resolute failed to demonstrate that the case should be heard in Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Resolute’s second lawsuit against Greenpeace. In 2013, the company filed a CAD$7 million defamation case against Greenpeace Canada and two staff members in Ontario, which is still pending. Click &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/resolutelawsuits/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more information about the existing legal cases between Resolute Forest Products and defendants, or copy this to your browser: &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/resolutelawsuits/"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/resolutelawsuits/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been present in Southeast Asia since 2000. Greenpeace has led successful campaigns in the region, including preventing the entry of hazardous waste imports and radioactive shipments, campaigning against destructive logging, stopping polluting technologies such as waste incinerators and coal power plants, promoting sustainable agriculture, renewable energy and necessary solutions to key environmental problems. Greenpeace actively campaigns across the region to catalyze an energy revolution, protect the world’s ancient forests, create a toxics-free future, and campaign for sustainable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has four offices in Southeast Asia – in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. GPSEA is composed of four departments --- the Campaigns Department, the Fundraising Department, Communications, and Organizational Support Department. Currently, Greenpeace has more than a hundred staff around the region, excluding the direct dialogue/fundraisers.&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, March 9 2016 - Falling international demand and plummeting coal prices are derailing Indonesia’s plans for expanding coal-fired power plants, as revealed this week by the Indonesian Coal Mining Association and PwC. The headlines focused on the possibility that the country’s coal reserves could be exhausted by 2033.  But for Indonesians, there is a more immediate threat.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Despite years of profitable mining, with gross profits of $6.5 billion in 2011, the Indonesian Coal Mining Association (APBI-ICMA) is now calling for a huge public subsidy, including a raid on the country’s pension funds, in order to survive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its call for the government to pay a surcharge of 1% on the basic cost of Rp 1400/kWh amounts to a subsidy of about US $230 million a year (Rp. 3.0 trillion).  The higher subsidy of 3% would cost the Indonesian taxpayer US $680 million a year (Rp. 8.9 trillion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsidy would be payable for 25-30 years, amounting to about US $6-7 billion - to provide 15 GW of coal-fired electricity, which is well below Indonesia’s energy needs.  It blows a huge hole in the coal association’s claim that coal is “relatively cheap” compared to other sources of electricity. The cost of producing solar electricity India, for example has fallen to $6.5c / kWh (Rp. 830/kWh  as a result of ambitious government policies.  That is less than 60% of the current cost of coal-generated electricity in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arif Fiyanto, senior campaigner for Greenpeace Indonesia, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indonesian coal companies cannot be allowed to get away with this crazy plan.  Not content with scarring the landscape and in many cases walking away from clean-up costs, the companies now expect ordinary Indonesians to bail them out of their financial mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indonesians will never accept their pension funds being raided to prop up an ailing coal industry in this way.  Sources of finance are drying up as banks and other investors recognise that the coal industry is becoming a huge stranded asset.  It’s clear the APBI-ICMA is unable to stand on its own feet, and has no future.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indonesia needs to turn its back on this fuel.  The money the coal companies are demanding would be better invested in renewable energy which, in the long term, would provide cleaner, cheaper energy for Indonesia people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace will be releasing a more detailed analysis of the APBI-ICMA’s proposals in the near future.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="box-content"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #808080;"&gt;There are as few as 400 Sumatran tigers left in Indonesia’s forests - and their time on earth is running out. Some companies are destroying their home for vast palm oil plantations and the global brands we know and love are not doing enough to keep their products forest friendly. Instead, they buy palm oil from a faceless corporation called Wilmar International, the world’s biggest palm oil trader whose practices are threatening orangutans, elephants and tigers, disrupting communities and ravaging the Indonesian landscape.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- INTRO BLOCK END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are going to change this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palm oil can be grown without destroying forests. We can make Wilmar stop buying palm oil from forest destruction, and push the government of Indonesia to strengthen forest protection. But this can only happen if we persuade the brands we love to become tiger friendly and remove forest destruction from their products. You have a right to know if tiger extinction is in the products you use everyday and we want brands to live up to your standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we are helping the products we love get a makeover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want forests in our future; we want to protect paradise. On our streets and online, we’re tracking down our favourite brands and telling them, their bosses and their staff to protect the Sumatran tiger’s last home. We’re spreading the word to get our friends, culture makers and policy makers, to join us. Your voice is powerful. We’ve done this before and we know we can win again.&lt;/p&gt;

	Quezon City, Philippines – In light of the recent avian flu outbreak, Greenpeace today recommended longer-term measures to address the spread of pathogens, which it says is indicative of a failing industrial food production system.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Leonora Lava, Food &amp;amp; Ecological Agriculture Campaigner of Greenpeace Philippines, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“While Greenpeace commends the government and industry efforts to contain the outbreak, we still see these as temporary measures, which will not address the issue head-on. In reality, there are no ‘confined operations’ in relation to public health.  In the case of avian flu, the pathogens are still freely moving from the ‘confined’ flocks to the external environment, and vice-versa.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; "&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The high concentration and close confinement of fowls in an industrial setting is almost like incubators for avian flu, which allows the breeding and spread of such diseases. In industrial livestock production, only one breed of fowl is raised. When a certain disease attacks, the fowls are all wiped out. The scene is different in backyard raising, where different breeds of fowls are raised, allowing resiliency in the system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The recent avian flu outbreak, where we have to slaughter hundreds of thousands of chickens to temporarily contain the pathogen for fear of spreading to humans, is a clear manifestation of the failure of the industrial food production system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is now high time for the government and us, citizens, to examine our food system. There is an urgent need to shift the model of our agriculture towards less concentrated, decentralized, more diversified and more small-holder farmer-centric ecological farming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"We need decentralized mechanisms, such as a National, as well as Local, Food Councils, where ordinary Filipinos can participate in decision-making towards crafting and implementing a sustainable food plan.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Manila, 30 May 2016 - Greenpeace Philippines welcomed the Climate Change Commission recently released Commission Resolution 2016-001, which calls for a "national policy review” of the country’s energy policy in order to reduce the country’s dependence on coal, and transition to renewable energy.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p id="docs-internal-guid-d7e964ab-00ae-3b6d-6ab4-47cc81ef4960" dir="ltr"&gt;Greenpeace expects that the results of this review of the energy sector may further encourage not only investments in renewable energy but also lay the groundwork for job growth in the renewables sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s about time that the Philippine government agencies come together to address the escalating climate problem facing Filipinos. Our global demands will only have the proper moral ascendancy if we walk the talk and are also applying our same recommendations at home,” said Amalie Obusan, Country Director of Greenpeace Philippines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The Philippines is at the forefront of climate impacts. Filipinos lose their lives, livelihood and opportunities year after year as a result of extreme weather events. We know we cannot afford to go on a path of development that is not sustainable and which will negate our economic gains in the long run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In our struggle for climate justice, we need to ensure a low-carbon energy path, and join the global movement in shifting to a fossil fuel-free future,” said Obusan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace is looking forward to the incoming Duterte Administration putting this resolution into practice. President-elect Rodrigo Duterte himself has stated his support for a transition to renewable energy sources &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;during the election campaign.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is great potential for renewable energy in the Philippines, but their development has been hampered by bureaucratic and administrative hurdles in policies and business models that favor fossil fuels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	As the Thai Union(TU)  Annual General Meeting (AGM) opens in Bangkok today with more than a thousand attendees, Greenpeace reiterates that reputational damage, destructive fishing methods, labor and human rights abuses in the supply chain are among the factors that investors and shareholders of Thai Union Group PLC. (TU) ought to be wary of if they continue to invest.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is running a global campaign (1) targeting Thai Union’s major brands and customers to drive improvements in the company’s tuna supply chains and beyond. Greenpeace has clearly asked the company to provide a timeline with steps on how it plans to move away from destructive fishing, such as the use of fish aggregating devices (FADs) in purse seine tuna fishing, address social responsibility, and ensure full traceability in its global supply chains. Thai Union has not yet done so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Governments, consumers and retailers are becoming increasingly aware of the need for better and more sustainable management in the seafood and fishing industry,” said Anchalee Pipattanawattanakul, Oceans Campaigner for Greenpeace Southeast Asia. “Investors and shareholders need to recognise the practices that Thai Union is engaged in, and determine whether being associated with the company is worth the reputational risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Thai Union Group PCL. announced an international consultation programme with key stakeholders as part of its Sea Change Sustainability Strategy (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace does not believe that Sea Change represents a shift towards a comprehensive programme of work that will address the rights of fishers working on vessels both inside and outside of Thai waters and flagged to countries other than Thailand. It also does not show how the company intends to move towards more sustainable fishing methods such as purse seine fishing without the use of harmful fish aggregating devices,”  added Pipattanawattanakul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Southeast Asia demands that Thai Union source only from more sustainable tuna fisheries, and put strict and comprehensive sourcing requirements in place across all supply chains that guarantee, through third party verification, that all seafood sourcing is free from human rights and labor abuses and is socially responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 15 May 2016 – Greenpeace Indonesia activists today climbed the cranes of two grab-type ship unloaders, blocking the supply of coal for the Cirebon Coal Power Plant. The protest in Indonesia, the world’s second biggest exporter of coal, is part of a global wave of ‘Break Free’ actions running from 4-15 May demanding governments keep coal, oil and gas in the ground.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The activists unfurled banners saying ‘Quit Coal’ and ‘Clean Energy, Clean Air’ from both cranes supplying the coal terminal and urged the government to immediately transition towards renewable energy. Communities near the coal power plant have protested its expansion plans since last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Every new coal-fired power plant means elevated health risks for Indonesians. Lives, including those of children, are cut short due to strokes, heart attacks, lung cancer and other cardiovascular and respiratory diseases,” said Arif Fiyanto, Climate and Energy Campaigner at Greenpeace Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Coal has a dirty history in Indonesia ranging from land grabs, violence against local communities, polluting our air and exporting climate change to the rest of the world. The time is now for ordinary Indonesians to show the government and foreign investors in our dirty coal industry that enough is enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Air pollution from coal in Indonesia has had a devastating effect on the country’s health. According  to a study Greenpeace Indonesia released with Harvard University researchers last year, existing coal plants in Indonesia already cause an estimated 7,100 premature deaths per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If all proposed new power plants are built, the study found that they could cause the death of a further 21,200 people, due to increased risk of stroke, lung cancer, heart disease and chronic respiratory diseases, as well as deaths of young children due to increased risk of acute respiratory infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;West Java’s Cirebon Coal Power Plant will be expanded as part of a national 35,000 MW power generation capacity addition project. Under this plan, over 60% of the additional 35,000 MW will come from coal power plants, while only 20% will come from renewables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The first unit at the Cirebon Coal Power Plant, in operation since July 2012, exploded in September 2014 causing injury to several workers. The expansion plan will be funded by JBIC (Japanese Bank for International Cooperation), the same bank behind another controversial coal power plant at Batang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“President Jokowi has a choice: stay with a business-as-usual approach to generating electricity and see the lives of thousands of Indonesians cut short, or lead the rapid transition to safe, clean, renewable energy,” Arif added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="text"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It is unthinkable for the government to expand fossil fuel projects following the Paris agreement. If we are to keep the average global temperature rise to well below two degrees, we must urgently end subsidies for fossil fuel companies and transition to 100% renewables.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Today’s action follows a protest on 11 May by over 3,500 people in Jakarta, led by people from several communities outside the capital who are resisting coal projects in Indonesia. Greenpeace is joining other NGOs and affected communities in South Africa, the Philippines, USA, Canada, Spain, and other coal affected countries as part of the ‘Break Free’ movement.&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 2 December 2016. Greenpeace has warned that environmental and human rights abuses are still endemic in the IOI Group’s supply chain, even though AidEnvironment’s complaint against the palm oil trader has been resolved. [1] 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner Annisa Rahmawati said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“If the IOI Group does what it is now promising, it would go some way to resolving its legacy of destruction in West Kalimantan. But it is still too early to tell whether there is light at the tunnel or just another dead end.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;AidEnvironment’s complaint related only to IOI’s concessions in West Kalimantan. The company also has a large network of plantations in Malaysia, and is a major trader of oil produced by other companies. Investigations by Indonesian, Malaysian and international civil society organisations have shown that environmental and human rights abuses are endemic in IOI’s supply chain. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, dozens of international brands stopped sourcing palm oil from IOI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“IOI has a lot of work to do before it would comply with international brands ‘no deforestation, no peat, no exploitation’ policies. It is still in conflict with local communities, exploiting its workers and buying palm oil from producers responsible for destroying forests, draining peatland and human rights abuses. Companies should wait for evidence that IOI has really changed before resuming trade.” Annisa said. [3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ENDS]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes for editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;[1] AidEnvironment, which lodged a complaint against the IOI Group with industry body the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), issued a joint statement with IOI on 1 December. &lt;a href="http://www.aidenvironment.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Joint-statement-on-Ketapang-Complaint-Aidenviroment-IOI-Final-20161201.pdf"&gt;http://www.aidenvironment.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Joint-statement-on-Ketapang-Complaint-Aidenviroment-IOI-Final-20161201.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;[2] An investigation by Greenpeace, published in September 2016, revealed that IOI had been sourcing its palm oil from producers known to be responsible for deforestation, peatland drainage and human rights abuses throughout Indonesia. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/Global/international/publications/forests/2016/Deadly-Trade-off-IOI-Report.pdf"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/forests/2016/Deadly-Trade-off-IOI-Report.pdf&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;An investigation by Finnwatch, published in November 2016, found that while some improvements had been made, many workers in IOI’s Malaysian concessions were still being paid less than the minimum wage — two years after it first raised the issue with the company. &lt;a href="http://www.finnwatch.org/images/pdf/IOI-2016_EN.pdf"&gt;http://www.finnwatch.org/images/pdf/IOI-2016_EN.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;A complaint by the Long Teran Kanan communities in Sarawak, East Malaysia, against IOI-Pelita, remains unresolved after six years.&lt;/div&gt;

	Teminabuan, West Papua-- A 3,545 hectare slice of Papua’s rainforest was today officially placed in community hands, to be protected and managed by the indigenous people of the Knasaimos landscape in West Papua’s Bird’s Head Peninsula. This is the first Village Forest to be established in Papua and it allows the communities of Manggroholo and Sira villages, situated in South Sorong district, to put a stop to the threat of deforestation from illegal logging, palm oil and pulpwood plantations.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Representatives of the Province of West Papua officially handed over the Village Forest management rights, initially valid for 35 years, to representatives of the two villages at an event in Teminabuan, the district capital. Traditional Tihor, Sayo, and Salawa dances were performed to greet participants in the ceremony, which was attended by around sixty members of the roughly 400-strong forest community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a victory not just for we residents of Sira and Manggroholo villages, but for everyone, especially here in Papua where much forest remains. Forest protection is vital to secure the future of our communities,” said Fredrick Sagisolo, head of the Knasaimos Tribal Council (Dewan Persekutuan Masyarakat Adat Knasaimos). “Our target is to extend the right to Village Forest to every village in the Knasaimos traditional domain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Village Forest sits within the 81,646-hectare Knasaimos indigenous territory, and comprises an area of 1,695 hectares to be managed by Manggroholo village, and 1,850 hectares for Sira village. During the 2000s, illegal loggers targeted merbau timber species in the Knasaimos area, and elsewhere in coastal Papua. Exported at a rate of 300 thousand cubic meters per month from Papua to factories making luxury flooring in China, the trade earned Papuans who collaborated with the industry less than half a cent per dollar’s worth of flooring sold in the west. [1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, plantation companies have eyed the area, and some have secured concession rights from government, within the Knasaimos forest landscape. Sira and Manggroholo village leaders however say they have rejected advances from palm oil companies, instead asking for help from local NGO Bentara Papua, which along with Greenpeace Indonesia, has assisted the community to establish its own indigenous association. Together the NGOs and community have undertaken a process of participative mapping, forest surveys and non-destructive forestry training. The Village Forest plan now includes collection of non-timber forest products such as damar resin, gaharu, and rotan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace supports community-based forest management which recognises sovereignty is in the hands of the local people. Papuan forests, increasingly succumbing to the expansion of oil palm, must be protected. The commitment of the Manggroholo-Sira community is an inspiration to others resisting deforestation in Papua,” said Kiki Taufik, Head of Greenpeace’s Indonesia Forests Campaign.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesian President Joko Widodo promised in 2014 to give forest-dwelling communities control over 12.7 million hectares of forest estate through community forestry schemes including Village Forest areas. The Sira-Manggroholo Village Forest is the first such area to be allocated in either of Indonesia’s two provinces which comprise Papua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representing the Governor of West Papua, provincial development and economy expert Niko Tike said: “The forest is like our mother, providing for our needs. It’s a must that we protect it and use it wisely, so that our requirements are always secured, now and in the future. If the forest is destroyed, it will mean disaster for us. I hope these two villages can become a model for others in driving community forestry in West Papua.”&lt;/p&gt;

	London – HSBC has just published a new ‘No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ policy covering its financing of palm oil companies. [1]

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The move by HSBC – Europe’s largest bank and a major funder of palm oil companies – follows an investigation by Greenpeace that linked it to companies destroying Indonesia’s rainforests. [2] Hundreds of thousands of people joined the campaign to change the bank’s policies, including 30,000 HSBC customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annisa Rahmawati, forest campaigner for Greenpeace Indonesia, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our rainforest is being carved up at a frightening rate and high street banks all over the world are funding this destruction. HSBC's commitment to break its ties to destructive palm oil companies is a good first step and Greenpeace will be watching closely to make sure it delivers. This also sends a clear signal that other global banks must follow suit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its new policy, HSBC has made stronger commitments to refuse finance for companies that clear forests and peatlands. If adopted across the banking sector, the policy would play a part in ending the role of banks in financing destructive palm oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new policy will require HSBC customers to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit to protecting natural forest and peat by 30 June 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify and protect forests and peat in new plantations prior to commencing new development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide independent verification of their No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation commitments by 31 December 2018.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shift towards making palm oil financing more sustainable is long overdue. The rate of deforestation in Indonesia has overtaken Brazil. Last year, orangutans were moved from ‘endangered’ to ‘critically endangered’ on the IUCN’s listings. [3] A recent study estimated that smoke from forest fires, which are fuelled by plantation companies clearing forests and draining peatlands, caused more than 100,000 premature deaths across South East Asia in 2015. [4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first critical test for the banking sector will be its response to South Korean conglomerate POSCO Daewoo, which is preparing to clear an area of Papuan rainforest larger than Cambridge. [5] New satellite images of PT Bio Inti Agrindo (a subsidiary of POSCO Daewoo) taken on 13 January 2017 show an estimated 4,000 hectares of rainforest crisscrossed by newly constructed roads, a key indicator of imminent plantation development. [6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research by Greenpeace showed that in the past five years, 13 banks – including HSBC, BNP Paribas and Standard Chartered – have been involved in providing POSCO Daewoo and its subsidiaries with loans totalling nearly US$3.6bn and bonds totalling over US$5bn. [7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is clear from these shocking images that HSBC’s client POSCO Daewoo intends to destroy a vast area of rainforest. This is the critical test for HSBC. It cannot in good conscience continue to fund POSCO Daewoo if it continues to carve up Papua’s rainforest.” said Annisa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace will today be writing to all of the other banks exposed by the ‘Dirty Bankers’ investigation to ask what action they will be taking, in light of HSBC’s new policy, to ensure they are not funding deforestation. [8]&lt;/p&gt;

	Hong Kong, 13 January 2017 - Approximately 50,000 lives a year could saved by 2030 if no new coal-fired power plants are built in Southeast Asia, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, according to a groundbreaking peer reviewed study from researchers at Harvard University and Greenpeace International.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div class="text"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air pollutant emissions from coal-fired power plants in these regions currently cause an  estimated 20,000 excess deaths per year, increasing to 70,000 by 2030 if coal-fired power plants presently planned or under construction go ahead. The majority of these mortalities (55,000 by 2030) will be in Southeast Asia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"While air pollution in China and India has received a lot of scientific attention, the impacts of planned coal power expansion in the rest of the Southeast and East Asian region have been  understudied,” said Shannon Koplitz, lead researcher in the project from Harvard University.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Reliance on coal in emerging Southeast Asian countries will have substantial and long-lasting impacts on air quality and public health. We estimate that tens of thousands of premature deaths could be avoided through cleaner energy choices. These significant human health costs should be considered when making choices about Southeast Asia’s energy future”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Authors from Harvard University Atmospheric Sciences modeling group, Harvard School of Public Health and Greenpeace mapped out current emissions from all coal-fired power plants in the region, and used a sophisticated atmospheric model to assess how much of current air pollution levels are due to coal emissions in different locations across Asia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If proposed coal-fired power plant projects go ahead, emissions from coal in Southeast Asia, Korea and Japan will triple by 2030 and could exceed total coal emissions in the U.S. and Europe, with the largest increases in Indonesia and Vietnam. Coal-fired power plants could be responsible for 70,000 premature deaths in the region every year, rivaling the 100,000 deaths from Indonesia’s 2015 smog. Indonesia will suffer the highest number of premature deaths, followed by Vietnam, with Myanmar experiencing the fourth highest mortality in 2030.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Planned coal expansion in Southeast Asia is a particular concern because of these countries’ extremely weak emission standards for power plants. All countries in the region allow many times more  pollution from new coal-fired power plants than China and India,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, Senior Global Coal Campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Countries in Southeast Asia have the chance now to leapfrog dirty, outdated technology like coal and move to renewable energy. Vietnam already took the first step by cancelling 17 large coal-fired power plants, reducing the projected health impacts from the country’s massive coal expansion by more than one fourth. Governments across the region have the chance to urgently shift their energy policies and save the lives of tens of thousands of their citizens.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Southeast Asia is one of the fastest developing regions in the world; electricity demand in 2035 is projected to increase by 83% from 2011 levels, more than twice the global average. Many countries in the region are still pursuing new coal-fired power plants, while lagging behind China and India in scaling up renewable energy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among developed countries, only Japan and South Korea continue stand out as the only ones to pursue new coal-fired power plants, in spite of their in contrast with climate commitments and concerns about public health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;China, the world’s largest emitter, has seen an overall decrease in coal consumption and associated pollutant emissions since 2013 and this trend will continue, despite recent jump in pollution. While China's pollution frequently spills over to neighboring countries, China could also start feeling the impacts of growing emissions outside of its borders. Some of the reductions in China’s air pollution could be offset by increases in Southeast Asia, as mainland China will see about 9,000 premature deaths in 2030 due to pollution from rising coal emissions from neighbouring countries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes to editors:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;[1] &lt;a class="zoom" href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.6b03731" target="_blank"&gt;Burden of Disease from Rising Coal-Fired Power Plant Emissions in Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt;, Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media contacts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace International Press Desk, &lt;img class="obfimg Eoi_1" src="/seasia/Templates/Planet3/Styles/Images/emailimages/c899bfb5de219c052742d9fedb8dbf40.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

	Migrant workers from Cambodia and Myanmar are being used as victims of forced labour in the Thai fishing industry. Using tricks of deception, non-binding verbal agreements and induced debt, these workers are the same people working for both human consumption and the pet food industry. Now, a new Greenpeace report exposes how crackdowns on human rights abuse in the Thai fishing industry has forced vessels to operate further...lessening their culpability to being caught and continuing their illegal practices out of sight, out at sea.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/PageFiles/745287/GP0STQEFH_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="Fishermen unload trash fish in Ranong, southern Thailand." width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 2015, an expose by the Associate Press on human rights violations in Thailand’s notorious fishing industry sent &lt;a href="https://www.ap.org/explore/seafood-from-slaves" target="_blank"&gt;shockwaves around the world&lt;/a&gt;. At the heart of the globe-spanning tragedy lay the often callous and illegal activities of companies in Thailand’s distant water fishing sector. Consumers everywhere were inspecting their tuna cans and wondering what horrors they were buying with their seafood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Thai Government tried to make the industry shape up, but instead, the fleets shipped out. Now a new Greenpeace report, &lt;a href="/seasia/Templates/Planet3/Pages/www.greenpeace.org/seasia/Press-Centre/publications/Turn-The-Tide" target="_blank"&gt;Turn the Tide&lt;/a&gt;, reveals cases of human rights abuse continuing onboard Thai distant water fishing vessels during much of 2016. This particular fleet is known to supply to global seafood markets, particularly the food service and pet food sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe style="width:600px; height:424px;" src="//e.issuu.com/embed.html#10477952/41961357" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vessels in question are mainly bottom trawlers and huge refrigerated cargo vessels, also known as reefers, capable of hauling over 19,000 tons of fish at a time, and travelling great distances as far as the Saya de Malha Bank in the Indian Ocean. The trawlers can stay at sea for several months enabling them to catch as much fish as they want, away from prying eyes and regulation. The reefers then pick up and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/high/news/Blogs/makingwaves/transhipment-tuna-pacific-fishing/blog/53914/" target="_blank"&gt;transship&lt;/a&gt; the fish back  to Thai ports for processing, as well as deliver supplies-- even trafficked workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many of the crew onboard these ships are migrant workers from Cambodia and Myanmar,  who meet the internationally-accepted definitions of victims of forced labour. By their own accounts, the sea had swallowed up their hopes and dreams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/PageFiles/745287/GP0STQEFR_Low_res_with_credit_line.jpg" alt="Tuna gillnetters Kor Navamongkolchai 1 and Kor Navamongkolchai 8 dock in Ranong on the Thailand-Myanmar border. Greenpeace investigations have uncovered that these vessels have been engaged in both human trafficking and IUU fishing in the Indian Ocean. " width="600"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In January 2016, Greenpeace traveled to Ranong province, southern Thailand to investigate reports of deaths among fishers on two Thai trawlers returning from the Saya de Malha Bank. At the time, there were reported outbreaks of Beriberi - a disease that affects both the cardiovascular and the nervous systems as a result of thiamine (B1) deficiency - among the Thai fishing fleets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace interviewed the Cambodian crew members who worked on a Thai vessel. They recounted how they were continuously at sea for nine months, working extremely long days-- with only three to four hours of rest in any day-- and no time off. To make matters worse, the crew were fed a very poor diet. The survivors explained how supplies would be transshipped at sea roughly every 90 days by reefers coming from the Thai port of Samut Sakhon to the Saya de Malha Bank. Fresh vegetables and meat, would be finished after 10 and 20 days, respectively — which meant that most of the time the crew’s diet consisted of polished white rice and fish. Daily exhaustion and poor diets led to these men getting sick and weak, to the point of death.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BK8_wngUDsw" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aside from health hazards, interviews with crew members revealed stories of deception and exploitation by the vessel operators, who deceived workers about the true nature of their employment, the terms of their contract, and their remuneration.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A senior crew member interviewed by Greenpeace claimed that fishers would incur around THB 20,000 (USD 571) in debt to a broker before even stepping aboard the vessel. Added to this would be an advance of THB 30,000 (USD 857), to spend on supplies or send home to their families. The senior crew member reported that the men would work for approximately six months to pay this off before being eligible to request another advance from the vessel operator.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deceiving migrants is a typical strategy for trafficking workers into the Thai fishing industry, and deceptive recruitment arrangements are commonly used to trick people into debt bondage and trafficking. All 15 of the victims interviewed by Greenpeace also claimed their families had reported brokers were deducting significant portions, up to 50%, of the advances paid against their earnings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Non-binding verbal agreements, inflated recruitment fees and induced debt, excessive working hours and chaotic payment systems all significantly increase opportunities for the exploitation and abuse of workers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This vicious cycle of human trafficking, abuse and exploitation-- aided by illegal transshipments at sea-- must end. The Thai government must completely ban transshipment activities to ensure that the fishing is regulated and that workers’ rights are protected from abuse and exploitation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Thai seafood and fishing industry must keep itself in check, be more accountable and be able to provide just compensation to their workforce. After all, these hardworking fishermen are the very reason why the industry exists and continues to prosper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Kuala Lumpur, 14 Feb 2016 -- Dissatisfied Malaysian customers today presented HSBC with a mock cheque to the value of 228,434 signatures urging the bank to “Stop Funding Forest Fires in Indonesia”. The HSBC customers were joined by activists from Greenpeace and other Malaysian civil society organizations including members of Pertubuhan Pelindung Khazanah Alam Malaysia (PEKA), who handed out leaflets to other customers and passers by at the bank’s head office in Kuala Lumpur.  

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The activity was part of an escalating global effort to highlight the involvement of europe’s largest bank in arranging US$16.3 billion of loans (and nearly US$2 billion of bonds) to companies whose Indonesian palm oil operations have destroyed vast areas of rainforest, peatland and orangutan habitat, seized land from local people, operated without legal permits, and caused forest fires. [1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We are asking customers to join this movement urging HSBC to stop funding deforestation. In the past five years alone, HSBC has been part of banking syndicates that arranged US$ 16.3 billion of loans to six companies whose palm oil operations have destroyed vast areas of rainforest, peatland and orangutan habitat in Indonesia,” said Octyanto Bagus Indra Kusuma, Greenpeace Southeast Asia Forest Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Greenpeace International’s recently published ‘&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/Dirty-Bankers/"&gt;Dirty Bankers&lt;/a&gt;’ report [2] documents loans and financial services from HSBC to palm oil companies responsible for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Destroying rainforest, including orangutan habitat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Seizing land from local people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Operating without legal permits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Abusing workers and using child labour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Forest fires&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Draining and developing carbon-rich peatland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Deforestation and peatland destruction by Indonesia’s palm oil and pulp sectors is widely acknowledged as a root cause of forest fires and haze. A study by Harvard and Columbia universities estimates that over 100,000 adults across Southeast Asia died prematurely as a result of the 2015 haze crisis. [3][4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Many of these actions breach the laws and regulations that govern Indonesia’s plantation sector. Lending to these companies also breaches HSBC’s sustainability policies. [5] The financial support provided by HSBC and other international banks contrasts sharply with public opinion and consumer companies demanding responsibly produced palm oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Last year the IUCN changed the classification of the Bornean orangutan from ‘endangered’ to ‘critically endangered’, citing ‘destruction, degradation and fragmentation of their habitats’ including conversion to plantations, as a main reason for the decline in population. [6]&lt;/p&gt;

	Lynas Corporation, Ltd. (Lynas) is an Australian rare earth elements mining company, built a refining and processing plant valued in excess of A$ 1 billion  in Kuantan, on Malaysia’s eastern Peninsula coast. The Lynas facility, which is set to become one of the world’s largest processing plants for rare earths, poses a host of intractable environmental and social problems. 


&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download the Report: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/seasia/PageFiles/620003/Chinese-Lynas.pdf"&gt;Chinese Version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/seasia/PageFiles/620003/Malay-Lynas.pdf"&gt;Malay Version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report recommends that Malaysian authorities should suspend Lynas’ temporary operating license, and refuse to grant the permanent operating licence, which is due to be granted in September 2014, unless Lynas completes a thorough overhaul of its facility’s construction defects to upgrade the plant to best environmental practices and presents a safe and acceptable plan for dealing with the radioactive waste stream from this plant outside of Malaysia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace believes that the Malaysian authorities should close down the Lynas operation in Kuantan until environmental protection protocols and conditions subject to the best standards are in place – the solution also involves not storing or disposing of radioactive waste in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lynas plant was not built according to best available technology. Lynas is not applying best environmental practices in Malaysia and is not working according to international standards with respect to: air emissions, water discharges, and temporary waste disposal arrangements. Furthermore, Lynas has no concrete plan for the final disposal of its waste, especially the radioactive fraction. Moreover, Lynas has not provided sufficient information for a detailed environmental impact assessment, so the full impact of the plant remains unclear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an Australian company, Lynas can, and should, live up to the standards set by its home country as well as to higher international standards. Malaysia has less stringent environmental regulations in place than many other countries, including Australia, where the company is registered and where it holds a permit under much stricter regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public information and public participation around the approval and construction of the Lynas plant have also been deficient. Documentation provided by Lynas to the regulators in order to obtain operating licences, was inadequate and not accessible to the public. This, in addition to concerns by local communities  that their health will be affected by the operations of the mega-plant, has fuelled snowballing protests against the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong public protests against the development were evident in the Kuantan and Balok areas nearby. Demonstrations subsequently radiated outwards, as the Lynas plant became an issue of public concern throughout Malaysia. As a result,  the Lynas’ plant has now become highly controversial in Malaysia. The trigger for this widespread unrest has centred around citizens’ genuine concerns about environmental and health impacts; in particular the impacts of the large volumes of radioactive and other toxic waste at stake, for which Lynas still has not put forward a safe, legal and acceptable solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless satisfactory and acceptable solutions are found to the issues being raised by local groups and  communities, closing down the Lynas plant appears to be the best option. Any attempt to resolve the current impasse must be transparent and with full public consultation and participation in further decisions and must include a complete and detailed Environmental Impact Assessment of the facility and consequently, the deployment of best available technology, which meets the highest international standards. The radioactive waste stream of the plant must also be dealt with safely and responsibly and must not be allowed to remain in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this report would show, Lynas oversold its proposal to the Malaysian authorities, and its commitments to deliver adequate safeguards for its operations in the country have proven hollow.  The Malaysian Government has the right to close down the plant if Lynas fails to meet the conditions of its Temporary Operating License (TOL), specifically involving the final disposal of the radioactive waste. Since the plant has hardly produced any REE, closing down the plant would hardly affect the global REE market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adopting these recommendations, the Malaysian government would be sending a clear signal to the entire rare earth elements industry in particular and other industries in general that there is no room for polluting practices anywhere, whether in industrialized countries or in the developing world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE REPORT INCLUDE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To Lynas Corporation, Ltd:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close the Lynas Advanced Materials Plant (LAMP) processing plant in Kuantan, Malaysia, until reliable and transparent environmental protection protocol and conditions are put in place and an acceptable solution for the management of the plant’s radioactive waste and its disposal outside of Malaysia, is found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure Lynas Corporation policy to conduct all operations outside Australia according to the highest possible standards, and at a minimum to standards and regulations, which would apply under Australian law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To the Federation of Malaysia Government (Persekutuan Malaysia) and the Pahang State Assembly (Dewan Undangan Negeri):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific to the Lynas Corporation in Kuantan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Deny Lynas Corporation a permanent operating license to ensure the health and well-being of its people and the protection of the environment, until the company institutes reliable and internationally recognised best practice environmental protection protocols and conditions for the operations of its plant in Kuantan, and comes up with an acceptable solution for the management and disposal of its radioactive waste outside Malaysia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demonstrate green development and protect the environment of Malaysia by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Developing sustainable development guidelines that protect Malaysian environmental and public health interests. To this end the government can adopt guiding principles and regulations which would begin to effectively implement the following when considering environmentally critical projects and investments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(i) The precautionary principle;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(ii) The polluter’s pay principle;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(iii) Public and community acceptance as a requirement of the EIA and related permit approval processes; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(iv) Pollution registries which require disclosure of environmental information from companies, as well as enactment and implementation of “public right to know” policies;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To the Australian Commonwealth Government:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitor and implement mechanisms to uphold its stringent environmental standards applied at home to Australian businesses with operations overseas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To the Government of Japan:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a part owner of Japan Oil, Gas and Metal National Corporation (JOGMEC), and as the most important financier of Lynas in Malaysia, discontinue all investment for LAMP, to prevent a repetition of the radioactive waste legacy scandal at Bukit Merah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To BASF SE, Siemens AG, and other ‘downstream’ companies:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refuse to enter into supply contracts with Lynas as long as the company is not compliant with best environmental practices and continues to evade responsibility for dealing with its plant’s radioactive waste management and disposal problems.&lt;/p&gt;

	I’m onboard the Greenpeace ship, the Esperanza, in the Western Indian Ocean on an important tuna quest. 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tuna is probably the most popular seafood commodity out there. People eat it for a number of reasons, mostly as a convenient and healthy snack. But did you know that the biggest tuna brand in the world hails from our part of the world? Thailand to be exact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img style="float: left;" title="Arifsyah Nasution" src="/seasia/PageFiles/728990/GP0STPU4V.jpg" alt="Arifsyah Nasution" width="350" height="233"&gt;Some of the most famous canned tuna brands sold in the world is owned by Thai Union such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sealect &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;in Thailand, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;John West&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the UK, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Petit Navire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in France and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chicken of the Sea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the US. These brands have made Thai Union the market leader on all things tuna. Unfortunately, Thai Union is also the leader of the pack when it comes to trashing our seas, which brings me back to my Esperanza mission.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Right now, the Esperanza crew and I are on the watch in the Western Indian Ocean where much of the world’s tuna is sourced. I’ve seen awesome things- wonderful views and amazing sea life!  But also, I’ve seen a lot of trash out there. They’re called fish aggregating devices or FADs. They’re man-made devices—usually in the form of bamboo, but they also include plastic nets and electronic beacons made up of plastic, metal and batteries— that are deployed at sea by purse seine fishing vessels to help lure and catch hundreds of tons of fish. Once fish are attracted by FADs, they gather around it until big purse seine nets (in the shape of purses) scoop and haul them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The problem with FADs it that they also attract marine life of all shapes and sizes- from juvenile tuna species to sharks and turtles! In fact, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the FADs we’re finding and pulling out of the Indian Ocean can be traced to Thai Union and their suppliers. These FADs result in an estimated 104,000 tonnes of by-catch of tunas, sharks, billfish and other animals being caught and then discarded back into the sea – dead or dying – every year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most of the FADs deployed in the Indian Ocean are the drifting type. They’ll be floating indefinitely since there are no guarantees that they will be taken back by the vessels that leave them. The Pew Trust’s report in 2012 estimated that every year there are at least 47,000 drifting FADs deployed around the globe. Believe me, these FADs look like floating trash and if you multiply them by the tens of thousands, it is not a pretty sight. It’s bad enough that FADs made with plastics don’t biodegrade, while those with batteries are a life-threatening toxic hazard. Worse, these FADs wash up on beaches and get caught in coral reefs where they are left unrecovered. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;his continuous FADs deployment by boats that catch fish for Thai Union and by the other tuna players will not only overfish our tuna stocks like skipjack and yellowfin, but will also increase the by-catch leading to more loss of sea life. The other consequences of uncontrolled FADs deployment will also increase marine debris in the oceans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;That is why Greenpeace and consumers all over the world are calling on Thai Union to clean up their supply chain by getting rid of destructive FADs that not only harm the marine environment, but also threaten the sustainability of our oceans. We’re also challenging Thai Union to treat their laborers fairly and make sure that they are not subjected to rights abuses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;So the Espy crew and I will continue to keep watch to mount more pressure on Thai Union to be the leaders of change in the tuna industry. As the biggest canned tuna processing industry in the world, Thai Union is clearly responsible for oceans destruction through their FADs used by purse seine vessels. Until they make necessary steps and ensure that their tuna supply chain is clean from any traces of destructive fishing and human rights abuses, Greenpeace will continue to remind Thai Union to stop trashing our oceans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are you consumers of canned tuna?  Are you an ocean lover who would like to take part in saving our oceans from destructive practices and other environmental crimes by the tuna industry? Please sign our petition to Thai Union here: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://tuna.greenpeace.org/#petition_modal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;http://tuna.greenpeace.org/#petition_modal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Manila, Philippines- A film in 1991, produced by Shell, shows that the oil giant has long known about the catastrophic risks of climate change. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The film, titled &lt;em&gt;Climate of Concern,&lt;/em&gt; was obtained by the Correspondent, a Dutch online journalism platform, and published in The Guardian’s article ‘&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/28/shell-knew-oil-giants-1991-film-warned-climate-change-danger"&gt;Shell knew’: oil giant's 1991 film warned of climate change danger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Desiree Llanos Dee, Climate Justice Campaigner for Greenpeace Southeast Asia- Philippines, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Exxon knew. Shell knew. Now we must get to the bottom of what other fossil majors know and what they plan to do to avert catastrophic climate change. Shell’s empty rhetoric on climate is wholly contradicted by the core assumption underlying its business plans - global temperature increases in excess of 3°C and its lobbying against measures to mitigate climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shell and other big fossil fuel companies will soon have to explain in public hearings in the Philippines how they have contributed to climate change, what human rights have been violated as a result, and how they will remedy and prevent future harm. This is part of the growing global movement of people demanding that our rights to a stable climate and healthy environment are protected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell is one of 47 carbon majors [1] being investigated in the world’s first national inquiry into the responsibility of the fossil fuel industry and others for human rights impacts resulting from climate change, being conducted by the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines. [2] Hearings are expected to begin in September this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The national inquiry in the Philippines is one of the many people-powered legal actions related to climate change initiated around the globe, from Indigenous Peoples in Canada, ‘Senior Women for Climate Protection’ in Switzerland, farmers from Peru and Pakistan, to youth in the United States and Norway, and Dutch and Belgian citizens. [3] In each of these cases, people are pushing back using the power of the law, because governments and fossil fuel companies are failing to protect and respect human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has led a high-profile campaign against Shell, which has included “kay-activists” in Portland, USA blocking an Arctic bound vessel; and pressure towards LEGO for using Shell branded products. In 2014, the toy company ended its relationship with Shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the oil giant abandoned drilling operations in the Arctic. &lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Amsterdam - Break Free from fossil fuels protests in Croatia and Israel have kickstarted the latest wave of protests by a global movement determined to accelerate the shift to an era of renewable energy, with further activities today in the Philippines and the Arab world.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;At the weekend, in the country’s first big climate mobilisation, 1500 people took part in a mass cycle ride in Croatia. In Israel, local communities denounced air pollution from coal-fired power plants, while across the &lt;a href="http://game.breakfree2017.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Arab world&lt;/a&gt; a game to phase out fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy was launched. Finally in the Philippines today, a coalition of civil society groups and coal-impacted communities rallied at the headquarters of a major fossil fuel company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Chile to Thailand, South Korea to Poland, coal mines, coal-fired power plants and their harmful pollution is the focus of people’s call for a cleaner and healthier energy future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agustin Maggio, a spokesperson for the Break Free movement, said: “The warning lights of dangerous climate change are flashing around the world, triggered by the burning of fossil fuels Look to the vanishing sea ice at both poles, the severe &lt;a href="http://www.fews.net/east-africa" target="_blank"&gt;drought&lt;/a&gt; in Africa or the Great Barrier Reef fighting for its life to see the damage this is already causing. This is why people everywhere are demanding action from their governments and the corporations that are so far refusing to move away from the dirty energy sources which are putting so many lives at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The only way to keep global warming to the 1.5C limit agreed in Paris is to break free from fossil fuels now and speed up the transition to a future based on affordable, renewable energy for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the role of Indigenous peoples in the fight against climate change, Fionuala Cregan of Land Rights Now said: “Indigenous peoples and local communities, whose land rights are &lt;a href="http://rightsandresources.org/en/publication/global-baseline-carbon-storage-collective-lands/#.WL3IqPKQHwY" target="_blank"&gt;disproportionately&lt;/a&gt; affected by fossil fuels, are so important not only in the movement against dirty energy, but also in protecting the planet from climate change. Despite their crucial role, Indigenous peoples around the world have full ownership rights to &lt;a href="http://rightsandresources.org/en/publication/whoownstheland/#.WL3HaPKQHwZ" target="_blank"&gt;less than 20 percent&lt;/a&gt; of their customary lands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the role of women in the fight against climate change, Osprey Orielle Lake of Women’s Earth and Climate Action Network (WECAN) said: “Women around the world are raising their voices and putting their bodies on the line to prevent the continued degradation of the Earth, our climate and our communities. Women are central to the solution to climate change. Even though they suffer more from its impacts, they demonstrate everyday extraordinary courage, brilliance and passion as they simultaneously fight oppressive government and corporate systems, while building the just and livable world we seek.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the people-powered call for climate justice, Desiree Llanos Dee of Greenpeace Southeast Asia said: “We are working with groups around the world to use the power of the law to protect our basic human rights to a stable climate and healthy environment. Around the world and in frontline communities in the Philippines, people are standing up for their lives, their rights, and their future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are part of Break Free because the vision, courage, and the diversity of the movement are exceptional reminders of what brings us together, what we strive to protect, what we are willing to fight for, and what kind of future we want. It takes a people-powered and people-centered movement to amplify the voices of the most vulnerable sectors and to increase pressure on governments and corporations to rapidly transition to 100% renewable energy and just societies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the state of the Great Barrier Reef, Sebastien Blavier of Greenpeace Australia Pacific said: “While the Reef is fighting for its life, the Australian government wants to use taxpayers' money to fund its destruction. Tackling climate change by breaking free from fossil fuels is the only real solution to save the Reef -- and that starts by ending public funding for climate-wrecking coal projects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On communities standing up to fracking, Rebekah Hinojosa of Save RGV from LNG in the US said: “Authorities and BNP Paribas are selling out our low-income Latino coastal communities to multi-billion dollar fracked-gas corporations seeking to exploit our land, including sacred Indigenous land, for overseas profit. Our families deserve clean air and water and a just economy that is not dependent on polluting fossil fuels corporations that will put our communities at risk. The Rio Grande Valley of Texas community has taken a stand and mobilised against these fracked-gas companies for over three years, and we will continue to resist.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace’s 12-month long investigation exposes the activities of Thailand’s rogue overseas fishing fleets, the companies behind them and their supply chain connections to export markets.

&lt;p&gt;Thailand is the world’s fourth largest seafood exporter, earning the country annual revenues of over USD 6.5 billion according to recent figures.&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1 &lt;/span&gt;In the last two years, Thailand’s overseas fishing industry has been put under the spotlight as a stream of hard-hitting reports exposed the shocking human rights abuses linked to supply chains of major global seafood producers.&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2/3 &lt;/span&gt;At the same time, the space in which unscrupulous Thai companies were able to operate freely was rapidly shrinking as Southeast Asian governments, including Thailand, took action against human trafficking and Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing. Drawing on a 12-month long investigation, this report details the last fishing frenzy made possible by the practice of transhipments at sea of Thailand’s rogue ghost fleets, before new regulations affected a temporary stoppage in distant water fishing from January to July 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turn the Tide&lt;/em&gt; outlines Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s investigationsinto IUU fishing, trafficking and other rights abuses — including fatalities resulting from negligence — aboard Thai distant water fishing vessels operating in the Indian Ocean. Research and analysis into fleet movements between 2014 and 2016 demonstrates how Thai overseas vessels fleeing crackdowns in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea arrived in an area of the Indian Ocean called the Saya de Malha Bank in the final half of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

	Amsterdam, Netherlands, 22 March 2018 — In response to the release of internal Shell​ ​documents today by Jelmer Mommers a climate and energy journalist for the Dutch news​ ​organisation De Correspondent, and published on Climate Files, Kees Kodde, campaigner for​ ​Greenpeace Netherlands, said:
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The new revelations confirm that Shell has known for decades that the burning of its fossil fuels products could lead to devastating climate impacts but chose to hide this information and undermine climate science and action in order to protect profits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“These internal reports increase the risk of legal action against Shell and add to the growing pile of evidence for climate lawsuits. Shell already faces legal threats on three continents over its contributions to the climate crisis with multiple climate lawsuits in the U.S., a potential case in the Netherlands, and an investigation by the Commission on Human Rights in the Philippines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It's time for Shell to accept responsibility and fully disclose to the public, shareholders, and consumers what the company knew about climate change, when, and what it did in response. We’re calling on Shell to show respect for human rights, plan for a swift and just transition out of fossil fuels, and pay its fair share of the costs of climate change.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;-ENDS-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Contacts:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kees Kodde, campaigner, Greenpeace Netherlands: &lt;img class="obfimg Eoi_1" src="/seasia/Templates/Planet3/Styles/Images/emailimages/1d16a27c4407e3bd466171b7aa99e264.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

	If the old adage “you are what you eat” is true, then most of us are eating from the hand of corporations. But a recent decision by the “people’s court” against Monsanto emphasises the need for change.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As you peruse your supermarket, inundated with choice or thinking about your weekly shopping list, the last thing that springs to mind is where your food comes from. Whilst the easy answer is the farm or factory, it’s alarming to think that &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/agriculture/problem/"&gt;10 companies&lt;/a&gt; – six agricultural giants and four global corporations - control the world’s food systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent giants, Monsanto sells products that undermine the necessary transition to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/agriculture/solution-ecological-farming/solutions/"&gt;ecological farming&lt;/a&gt; and instead pushes for the use of toxic agrochemical and genetically engineered (GE) seeds that reinforce big corporate control over farmers and the food system. Furthermore, Monsanto is currently undergoing a merger with another titan, Bayer, thus increasing their grip over our food system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind this deal and others made by agribusiness, there are soils drained of nutrients, poisoned waterways, unsustainable production practices - and it’s all going into our bodies. In 2016, a Greenpeace Japan &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/press/releases/2016/Research-shows-switching-to-organic-food-can-reduce-pesticide-levels-in-urine/"&gt;social experiment&lt;/a&gt; showed that switching people’s diet from conventional to organic food significantly reduced the pesticide levels in their urine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="The International Monsanto Tribunal at the Hague" src="/seasia/Global/seasia/Monsanto%20tribunal.jpg" alt="Netherlands, The Hague october 14 2016International Monsanto Tribunal in the Hague, NetherlandsScenes from the pressconferenceCOPYRIGHT DIGITAL IMAGE 2016 BAS BEENTJES/GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL " width="800" height="533"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why farmers, scientists and activists from all over the world gathered at &lt;a href="http://www.monsanto-tribunal.org/"&gt;the Monsanto Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; in the Hague, Netherlands, last year to present the case - albeit a people’s one - against destruction caused by one of the corporate giants that promotes industrial farming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/5-reasons-monsanto-tribunal-agriculture/blog/57701/"&gt;October 2016&lt;/a&gt;, communities around the world who have suffered from the corporation’s approach to agriculture aimed to hold Monsanto to account for its alleged atrocities against humanity and the environment. Six detailed questions were submitted to the Tribunal and they constitute its terms of reference: the right to a healthy environment, the right to food, the right to health, freedom of scientific research, complicity in war crimes, and ecocide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, earlier this month, the communities reconvened and the recommendation was made, in which its impact is a small step towards reclaiming food and farming from corporate control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an opinion handed down by real, internationally eminent and independent judges presiding the case, they stated that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…The impacts of Monsanto’s conduct on biodiversity have also negatively affected the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities. These impacts are all the more grave, given the close dependency of indigenous peoples and local communities on the environment. The lack of adequate information on risks posed by herbicides and GMOs and the lack of adequate mitigation measures, the lack of credible environmental impact assessments, and the lack of meaningful consultations; they all further underscore Monsanto’s interference with human rights…” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today’s dominant agro-industrial model is highly problematic, not only because it is dependent on dangerous chemicals, but also due to its negative effects on climate change, its impact on the loss of biodiversity, and its inability to ensure food sovereignty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Our food, our future&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the Tribunal is an initiative without a legal basis the opinions came from real and independent judges. While we are waiting to see how the legal opinion will shape the food battle worldwide, the people’s movement is growing to protect citizens and the environment from toxic pesticides.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, more than 600,000 citizens have already supported a &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/page/5212/petition/1"&gt;European Citizens Initiative&lt;/a&gt; to ban Glyphosate, the most used weed-killer globally and the main ingredient of Monsanto’s Roundup, classified by the WHO as potentially carcinogenic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over in Thailand, civil society organisations have successfully pressured their government to ban two major toxic chemicals - paraquat and chlorpyrifos, a herbicide and an insecticide accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the US, over 300 food and farm groups &lt;a href="http://www.foe.org/news/news-releases/2017-02-over-300-food-and-farm-groups-urge-jeff-sessions-to-oppose-ag-mega-mergers"&gt;signed an open letter&lt;/a&gt; to ask the Department of Justice to oppose the &lt;a href="http://www.etcgroup.org/sites/www.etcgroup.org/files/files/etc_breakbad_23dec15.pdf"&gt;mega mergers&lt;/a&gt; happening in agriculture. Similarly, more than 200 organisations have signed &lt;a href="http://www.foeeurope.org/sites/default/files/agriculture/2017/open-letter-agri-business-mergers-270317.pdf"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to the European Commission on agri-business mergers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the growth of local, slow or organic food movements are growing around the world, it’s continual pressure on governments, the further spreading of information, and people power that’s going to give the food system we want and are truly going to expose gaps and systemic failure in corporate accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, this doesn’t just affect farmers but every single one of us. It is &lt;a href="http://m.greenpeace.org/international/en/high/Agriculture/"&gt;our food, our future&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

	Manila, Philippines - Acting on the urgency of the plastics pollution problem in the region, and with the upcoming Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) Summit commencing in Manila, Greenpeace Southeast Asia brought its message to the ASEAN community by delivering a letter of appeal, brought by a giant animated ‘Plastic Bag Man and Woman’, to the respective embassies of Indonesia, Malay
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The letter of appeal urges the ASEAN member states to ban single-use plastics, and to unite and act to address plastics and marine debris pollution. Greenpeace is asking ASEAN governments to stiffen policies on waste management to arrest the rising rate of waste being dumped into the ocean and finding their way to the open seas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-use plastic refers to bags, bottles, straws, and the likes, that are usually disposed after one-time use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2015 study named five member states of the ASEAN as among the biggest sources of plastics pollution in the world’s oceans: Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia[1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ASEAN region’s contribution to plastic pollution in the oceans cannot be ignored and is already way beyond alarming. We are asking the ASEAN membership to take this issue with a sense of urgency and demand that our leaders initiate bold steps to address plastics pollution through regional cooperation, exacting corporate responsibility and massive public education,” said Abigail Aguilar, Detox Campaigner of Greenpeace Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure of these waste management systems is one of the primary causes of plastic waste entering the oceans. This is compounded by additional factors, including lack of infrastructure, harmful human activities, an inadequate public understanding of the potential consequences of their actions, the lack of adequate legal and enforcement systems nationally and internationally, and a lack of financial resources[2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group is also calling for corporate responsibility, with the consumer goods sector cited as a primary user of plastics. The social and environmental impacts of their use of plastics have been quantified in their ‘natural capital cost’, which equates to a monetary value of US$75bn per year. The natural capital cost to marine ecosystems of plastic waste is US$13bn per year. In one study, only half of 100 companies assessed reported quantitative data on plastics. There is a multitude of opportunities for the corporate sector to take greater responsibility for the pollutants they create and identify methods to reduce the quantity of plastics used and increase recyclability of their products[3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“ASEAN needs to up its game and demand full disclosure of important information from corporations who profit from single-use plastics. Corporations need to take responsibility for their environmental impacts and seek to transform their practices to bring about a cleaner supply chain. This is an important step in reducing plastics wastes at source,” Aguilar added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oceans are already filled with 275 million tons of plastics. The cumulative quantity of plastic waste available to enter the ocean from land is predicted to increase by an order of magnitude by 2025. The Ellen Macarthur Foundation projects that plastics in the ocean will outweigh fish by 2050. Every year, 8 million metric tons of plastic currently arrive in our oceans which is equivalent to five grocery bags filled with plastic for every foot of coastline in the world[4].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The amount of plastic debris in our oceans has already reached critical levels. The ASEAN needs to work together to set appropriate regulations and encourage businesses, communities, and consumers to take action,” Aguilar said. &lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 20 August 2018 – NGOs took action today in front of the Indonesian ministry responsible for lands to protest its failure to implement a Supreme Court decision ordering forest data be released to the public. Secrecy over the Land Cultivation Right data, (Hak Guna Usaha - HGU), contributes to corruption and mismanagement in the forestry and plantation sector.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For over a year the Ministry of Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning/National Land Agency (ATR/BPN) has refused to execute a Supreme Court’s instruction, to release details including maps of land controlled by palm oil plantation companies in Indonesian Borneo. The demonstration and award of a ‘trophy’ to mark this failure was conducted by the Civil Society Coalition for Transparency, comprised of Greenpeace Indonesia, Forest Watch Indonesia, Indonesian Corruption Watch, and PERDU Manokwari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace is highlighting ongoing deforestation in Borneo and Papua, including conversion of endangered species’ habitats by plantation companies [2],[3]. “If we are to halt deforestation and forest fires, we need transparency so that the public knows which companies are still acting irresponsibly,” said Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner Asep Komarudin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Forest Watch Indonesia campaigner Agung Ady stressed the importance of Land &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cultivation &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Right data.  “Between 2013 and 2016, there were cases involving 8.9 million hectares of land subject to overlapping claims between forestry, mining and oil palm plantations. There are also many overlaps with indigenous land rights. ATR/BPN’s recalcitrance means that the government is acting as a brake on settlement of tenurial conflicts.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Law enforcement in the forest and natural resources sector is rare, leading to massive public losses. “Over the past seven years, over 300 people have been declared suspects in corruption cases in the plantation, forestry and mining sectors. In just seven of these natural resource corruption cases, state losses reached 7.26 trillion rupiah,” said Tama S Langkun, Indonesian Corruption Watch researcher.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Corporate investment in Papua, especially in the plantation and mining sectors, has raised concern among indigenous Papuans for whom forests are central to traditional livelihoods. "Investment without oversight, and a government system with zero transparency has resulted in rapid deforestation and disregard for the rights of indigenous Papuans. If this situation is not turned around, Papua’s forests and people face a grim future,” said Andreas Bernadus from the PERDU Foundation in Manokwari, West Papua.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“ATR/BPN’s refusal to release Land Cultivation Right information has tarnished President Joko Widodo’s public commitment to transparency and freedom of information,” concluded Asep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;***&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Photos from the demonstration are available here: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://media.greenpeace.org/shoot/27MZIFJWTI4YL"&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://media.greenpeace.org/shoot/27MZIFJWTI4YL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Jayapura -– The Greenpeace ship, the Rainbow Warrior III, arrived in Jayapura, Indonesia today to document one of the world’s most biodiverse – and threatened –  environments,  just three years after the Indonesian navy escorted the Rainbow Warrior II out of its territorial waters in October 2010.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“The Rainbow Warrior is here to raise awareness of Indonesia’s rich yet fragile environment, and to support President Susilo Bambang Yudyohono’s commitment to protect the country’s forests and to restore our living oceans back to health,” said Greenpeace Indonesia’s Country Director, Longgena Ginting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Indonesia is home to some of the richest biodiversity spots on earth, but continued land clearance to make way for industrial plantations and overfishing of our country’s oceans are putting this all at risk. We hope our visit will support the political will needed to save this precious part of the world and to add to growing momentum to have the forests moratorium strengthened.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Approximately 10% of the world’s rainforests are located in Indonesia. Fifty years ago, 82% of Indonesia was covered with forests but in the last decade, this has dropped to 48% due to rampant deforestation for paper and oil palm plantations and mining.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indonesia’s seas are also among the most diverse coastal and marine habitats. However, experts identify the country’s coral reefs as among the world’s most threatened biodiversity hotspots, at risk from overfishing, pollution and climate change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a meeting with Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo, in Jakarta on June 7, 2012, Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono accepted Naidoo’s invitation to visit the ship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 25 October 2010, the Rainbow Warrior II was escorted out of Indonesian waters after the government refused to let the ship dock in Jakarta. On its current tour, the Rainbow Warrior III will sail from Papua to Jakarta from May 9 to June 10.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Rainbow Warrior has been the heart and soul of Greenpeace global campaigning for over 30 years. She’s been raided, rammed, shot at and bombed, but the spirit of the Rainbow Warrior is as strong as ever,” said Longgena.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Rainbow Warrior tour of Indonesia is part of the Greenpeace “Ocean Defender tour of Southeast Asia.” In June and July, the Greenpeace ship Esperanza will continue this tour in Thailand and the Philippines to call for oceans protection throughout the region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media contact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tristan Tremschnig, Communications Coordinator Indonesia Forests, +62 812 953 893 69 (Indonesia), &lt;img class="obfimg Eoi_1" src="/seasia/Templates/Planet3/Styles/Images/emailimages/fc77ec6f9466a3a46a49a6ee78e005ee.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

	Jakarta/Bangkok/Manila, 20 June 2013—Greenpeace today called on Southeast Asia and world governments to get serious about addressing climate change, following the release of the World Bank report Turn Down The Heat: Climate Extremes, Regional Impacts, and the Case for Resilience (1).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The report is the latest--and so far the grimmest--scientific study on climate change impacts in Southeast Asia. It details projected negative impacts of 2 degrees and 4 degrees warming on agricultural production, water resources, coastal ecosystems and cities in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Southeast Asia is already reeling from the impacts of climate change such as extreme weather. But this report gives an even bleaker picture of the future of the region, where weather extremes, sea-level rise and ocean warming and acidification will cause more devastation and human suffering,” said Amalie Obusan, Regional Climate and Energy Campaigner for Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The use of fossil fuels such as coal is the main culprit. Fossil fuels are being extracted and burned in the name of development and prosperity, but what they are delivering is the opposite, as the World Bank's report so clearly underlines,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia has been cited as one of most vulnerable regions to climate change due to high population concentrations along its coastlines and its low capacity to adapt and respond. Impacts are already being felt: massive flooding, landslides and droughts across the region causing hundreds of thousands worth of damages to property and human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of these already serious impacts, the World Bank report projects that extreme weather events are going to be more severe in the coming decades. For example, the projected sea level rise in Southeast Asia by the end of the 21st century is 10-15 percent higher than the global average. Manila, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City and Bangkok are expected to experience regional sea level rise exceeding 50 cm above current levels by 2060.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report predicts reduced crop yields due to sea-level rise in the Mekong Delta, as well as warming throughout the region. Major losses in fish production will also heavily affect food security. By 2050, increased water temperatures will severely affect fish in the Java Sea in Indonesia as well as the Gulf of Thailand. In southern Philippines, maximum fish catch potential is predicted to decrease by 50 percent. Meanwhile, all coral reefs in the region are predicted to experience severe thermal stress by the year 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the countries in Southeast Asia which will suffer the most from climate change are the same ones pursuing the road to aggressive coal development. Coal power plant development in the region is at an alarming high. There are currently at least 80 proposed coal-fired power plants totalling more than 58 Gigawatts (58,007 MW). These projects will accelerate climate change instead of mitigating it, fast-tracking and worsening global warming’s negative impacts in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given the devastating impacts on the region, the onus is on Southeast Asian leaders to call for global climate change solutions, as well as to enact renewable energy solutions at home. Southeast Asian leaders must ensure that the ASEAN economic community building is low carbon and sustainable by considering on one hand policy support for renewable energy and on the other hand policy reform to de-subsidize coal and oil,” Obusan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bold action is also needed from all governments, and the World Bank must lead the way by shifting all its energy financing from fossil fuels to renewables and energy efficiency. Alongside this, SEA governments must pursue development that protects and does not destroy biodiversity. These are the only solutions that can truly end poverty and avert catastrophic climate change.”&lt;br&gt;___&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For information, please contact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 22 October, 2013 - Household brands that source palm oil through Singapore-based palm oil trader Wilmar International, such as the makers of Oreo biscuits, Gillette shaving products and Clearasil, are making consumers unwitting accomplices in the destruction of Indonesia’s forests, and pushing critically endangered species like the Sumatran tiger to the edge of extinction, revealed Greenpeace International today in fresh investigations.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“As the world’s biggest player in the palm oil sector, Wilmar has the power to transform the industry. But until Wilmar commits to a no-deforestation policy, their trade of palm oil to big household brands such as P&amp;amp;G, Mondelez and Reckitt Benckiser make consumers unwitting accomplices in the extinction of Indonesia’s 400 remaining Sumatran tigers,” said Bustar Maitar, head of the Indonesian Forest Campaign for Greenpeace International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The palm oil sector is the largest driver of deforestation in Indonesia and the vast majority of the forest cleared in identified oil palm concessions in Sumatra during 2009–2011 was tiger habitat. The plantation sector is the chief threat to Sumatran tigers, with up to 1 million hectares of prime tiger habitat already allocated to concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has evidence of trade by Wilmar from companies whose operations include illegal clearance, fires on peatland and extensive clearance of tiger habitat. The report also documents illegal oil palm plantations within Tesso Nilo National Park, harvests from which have previously been tracked to Wilmar’s own mills and that continue to feed into Indonesia’s palm oil supply chain. Palm oil plantations are driving the destruction of Tesso Nilo National Park, of which only a quarter now remains, according to Greenpeace’s mapping analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Wilmar has undertaken to preserve high conservation value (HCV) forests and peatland on its own concessions, these areas supply less than 4% of the palm oil it trades and refines, with the remainder being produced by third-party suppliers. Wilmar has no proper systems in place to ensure traceability in their supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace demands that Wilmar stops laundering dirty palm oil onto global markets and that household brands clean up their supply chains. On 20 October 2013, Greenpeace Southeast Asia unfurled a banner challenging the trader to choose forest protection over forest destruction, within a Wilmar concession in Jambi with documented clearance of tiger habitat counter to RSPO rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace has a history of exposing illegality and gross environmental abuse linked to corporations  – from Russian oil giants in the Arctic, for which 30 of our peaceful activists are currently in jail, to reformed forest destroyers like APP in Indonesia. The challenge is on for Wilmar and its customers to clean up their act. Greenpeace will continue to stand with the millions of people in the region who have suffered enough from forest destruction,” said Bustar, in reference to the forest fire crisis earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace’s investigations reveal that household names including Colgate Palmolive, Mondelez International, biofuels giant Neste Oil, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, personal care producer Reckitt Benckiser and several other companies are purchasing dirty palm oil that is laundered onto the global market by Wilmar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Commitments like those made by members of the Palm Oil Innovation Group, or by Nestle, prove that an end to forest destruction is possible. Palm oil is a critical part of the Indonesian economy. Wilmar must use its position as a so-called leader to make a genuine contribution to Indonesia’s development, rather than destroying the future for its people, its wildlife and the global climate on which we all depend,” said Yuyun Indradi, Greenpeace Southeast Asia Forest Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;

	As few as 400 tigers are thought to remain in the rainforests of Sumatra, which are vanishing at a staggering rate – a quarter of a million hectares every year. Expansion of oil palm and pulpwood plantations was responsible for nearly two-thirds of the destruction of tiger habitat from 2009 to 2011, the most recent period for which official Indonesian government data are available. Such destruction fragments the extensive tracts of rainforest over which tigers need to range in order to hunt.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Although Wilmar has undertaken to preserve high conservation value (HCV) forests and peatland on its own concessions, these areas supply less than 4% of the palm oil it trades and refines, with the remainder being produced by third-party suppliers. In relation to Wilmar, Greenpeace has documented deep peatland fires in oil palm concessions; wholesale rainforest destruction and illegal oil palm plantations within the Tesso Nilo National Park, harvests from which have previously been tracked to Wilmar’s own mills and which continue to feed into Indonesia’s palm oil supply chain; and extensive clearance of both tiger and orang-utan habitat. Wilmar is known to own, have a significant stake in or trade with most of the producers Greenpeace has documented as engaging in such irresponsible or illegal activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-configid="2537715/5319891" style="width: 525px; height: 371px;" class="issuuembed"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="//e.issuu.com/embed.js" async="true"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace’s investigations have revealed that household names including Colgate Palmolive, Mondelez International (formerly Kraft), Neste Oil, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser and a host of other companies are linked to Singapore-based Wilmar International Ltd and its international trade in dirty palm oil. Wilmar is the world’s largest palm oil processor, accounting for over one-third of the global palm oil processing market and with a distribution network covering over 50 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace believes that Wilmar and the household brands that buy its palm oil must recognise the true costs of irresponsible palm oil production. They need to ensure that their palm oil supply makes a genuine contribution to Indonesia’s development, rather than destroying the future for its people, its wildlife and the global climate on which we all depend.&lt;/p&gt;

	Oil palm plantations are the largest driver of deforestation in Indonesia. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="371" src="//e.issuu.com/embed.html#2537715/4676226" width="525"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) was formed in 2004 to promote the use of sustainable palm oil through credible global standards and engagement of stakeholders. It is a voluntary association, consisting of palm oil producers, processors and traders, consumer goods manufacturers, retailers, banks and investors as well as some environmental and social non-governmental organisations. RSPO members account for around 40% of global palm oil production. The RSPO wants its members to be industry leaders in sustainability. However, its current standards leave its members free to destroy forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our report shows that RSPO certification is not protecting international household brands from the risk that the palm oil they use is tainted with deforestation. RSPO standards are not prohibiting deforestation and peatland destruction. Mapping analysis shows significant deforestation in concessions currently owned by RSPO members, and a significant share of the fires that covered Southeast Asia in haze this June were in RSPO member concessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RSPO recently reviewed its Principles and Criteria, but failed to address crucial questions of deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions, leading to criticism both from consumer companies and NGOs. Companies seeking deforestation-free palm oil now need to go beyond RSPO if they want to break the link between palm oil and deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo met with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on board the Greenpeace ship, the Rainbow Warrior, in Jakarta yesterday, to express Greenpeace’s support for the President’s legacy of protecting the nation’s biodiversity.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“I am pleased to meet with my friend Kumi Naidoo from Greenpeace. I would like to express my gratitude to Greenpeace for having made these efforts to save the environment of Indonesia and the rest of the world,” said President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a developing country, Indonesia needs economic development, but of course it must be environmentally sustainable. Although, we are facing several challenges, we are committed to working on both. I want to guarantee my grandchildren a clean and peaceful environment in the future,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace is honored to welcome the President on board the Rainbow Warrior and hope that his presence on board this symbol of environmental protection will lead to ever greater protection for Indonesia’s incredible natural heritage and the people who rely on it to survive,” said Naidoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The President should be congratulated on the progress his government has made on forest protection since our first meeting last year. There is still crucial work to be done but we at Greenpeace can assure the President that we will do whatever we can to support the Government’s commitment to zero deforestation,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior has just sailed through some of the most beautiful and precious – but also most threatened – waters in the world to meet the President here in Jakarta. It is clear that with so many of his citizens reliant on the oceans for their livelihoods that protecting the health of Indonesian waters is high on the President’s agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are all working to ensure protection of Indonesia’s biodiversity, not just for the environment’s sake, but also to ensure social justice. It is the poorest rural people who are most dependent on natural habitats for their livelihoods and it is they who suffer first and most deeply when those habitats are degraded or destroyed,” said Naidoo.  Greenpeace hopes that after his final term, the President will continue his efforts to protect the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace flagship, the Rainbow Warrior, is concluding a one-month tour of Indonesia to raise awareness of the country’s rich, yet threatened, biodiversity. Approximately 10% of the world’s rainforests are located in Indonesia. Fifty years ago, 82% of Indonesia was covered with forests but in the past decade, this has dropped to 48% due to relentless deforestation for pulp and paper, palm oil plantations and mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is identified as one of the megadiverse countries in the world.  The two other megadiverse countries in Southeast Asia are the Philippines and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Southeast Asia’s megadiverse countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines should be leading the way in forest and oceans protection in the region,” said Beau Baconguis, Philippines Program Manager for Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The region is one of the key battlegrounds where the fight to save the planet will be won or lost. The region’s fast-paced economic progress must be matched by robust environmental policies to ensure just and sustainable development for current and future generations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior tour of Indonesia is part of the Greenpeace “Ocean Defender tour of Southeast Asia 2013.” Greenpeace is inviting people throughout the region to join the movement to protect Southeast Asia’s Oceans by signing up as an Ocean Defender at &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.defendouroceans.org%2F&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEGVmOKWkYYNk3_VhqNlKORpWXIPQ" target="_blank"&gt;www.defendouroceans.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organization which uses non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental problems, and to force solutions essential to a green and peaceful future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Bogor, December 21, 2015 - Representatives of affected communities near coal mines and coal-powered electricity plants from all over Indonesia demand President Joko Widodo to fulfill his campaign promise to place the people’s welfare above interests of companies and investors. The community gathered in Bogor from Friday, December 18, said that they had experienced negative effects even though in some areas construction has not yet begun.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p class="Body"&gt;"We do not want to experience the same fate those living around other power plants. I was jailed for seven months for opposing the construction of this power plant," said Cayadi, Community Representative of the Ujungnegoro, Karanggeneng, Ponowareng, Wonokerso, Roban (UKPWR), Batang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past five years, UKPWR Batang consistently resist construction plans to build the largest coal power plant in Southeast Asia on fertile agricultural land and rich territorial waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="Body"&gt;In addition to representatives of UKPWR Batang, the meeting was also attended by the Environment Defender Community (Rapel) Cirebon who have been fighting against the construction of Cirebon power plant (PLTU); representatives of affected communities of PLTU Tanjung Jati B Jepara; representatives of affected communities of PLTU Paiton, Probolinggo; representatives of affected communities of PLTU Indramayu; PLTU Pelabuhan Ratu; PLTU Labuan Banten and representatives of communities affected by coal mining from East Kalimantan and Sumatra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As representatives of affected communities of the planned Cirebon power plant, I urge President Jokowi to cancel the construction plan of the PLTU Cirebon unit II, and review the operation permit of PLTU Cirebon unit I. Although they have only operate in less than two years, this plant has caused a number of negative impacts to the surrounding communities. Starting from health impacts, breakdown of social network, until the loss of livelihood of mostly farmers and fishermen," said Aan Anwarudin, Head of Rapel Cirebon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This meeting is the first that brings together representatives of affected communities in coal and mining coal from all over Indonesia. We want this meeting to echo the voices of the coal industry victims which has been ignored by the government. The state must ensure safety of the people from impacts of this dirty industry," said Hindun Mulaika, Climate and Energy Campaigner Team Leader of Greenpeace Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this meeting, representatives of communities affected by coal mining in coal deliver a manifesto demanding the government to stop its reliance on dirty coal energy, make serious efforts to develop clean and renewable energy and ensure people's right to a healthy and clean environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We organise the meeting because President Jokowi has failed to protect the people of Indonesia from threats of dirty energy. In Batang, Jokowi favors interests of corporations and foreign investors, instead of farmers and fishermen which are his voters in the last election. We hope this national movement against coal that emerged from the people directly impacted can awaken Jokowi, the people’s president, that he must listen to aspirations of the people," said Pius Ginting of the Indonesian Forum for Environment (Walhi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From the unloading, transport to combustion in power plants, coal is a source of catastrophe that disregard safety of the people. It raises the temperature, exacerbating climate change that threaten safety of human beings. The people present at this meeting sternly demand President Jokowi to prioritize safety of the people from the threat of coal," says Hendrik Siregar, Mining Advocacy Network  (Jatam) Coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="Body"&gt;Greenpeace, the Indonesian Forum for Environment (Walhi), and the Mining Advocacy Network (Jatam) is a coalition of environmental organisations active in highlighting the damaging impacts of the dirty energy-based industries in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

	Yangon, 4 May 2017 - Approximately 7,100 lives could be saved every year if Myanmar cancels its massive plan to build coal-fired power plants, and instead invest on renewable energy to meet the country’s electricity demand.
This is according to a report launched today by Greenpeace Southeast Asia, EcoDev/ALARM, Myanmar Green Network, Paung Ku, EarthRights International (ERI) and Heinrich Böll Stiftung Myanmar (HBS), based on the latest research by Harvard University and Greenpeace [1].
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“While the rest of the world is phasing out coal and moving to renewable energy, Myanmar is pursuing coal power expansion that could almost triple the emissions of major air pollutants in the country and double the country’s carbon dioxide emissions from energy,” said Lauri Millyvirta, Greenpeace Climate and Energy Campaigner. “More importantly, these plans do not take into account the human health costs when making choices about the country’s energy future.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the World Health Organization, Myanmar has by far the most polluted air in the Southeast Asian region. In fact, all of the 10 ASEAN cities with highest particulate matter levels are found in Myanmar. Coal combustion is one of the major sources of particulate matter pollution globally, emitting much higher levels of SO2, NOx and dust, the key contributors to PM2.5, than any other form of electricity generation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;That Myanmar is planning on a massive increase in coal plants to provide all the country’s energy needs by 2030 is alarming. The authors of the report developed a detailed database of emissions from existing and planned coal-fired power plants across Southeast Asia and used advanced atmospheric Geos-CHEM modelling to project impacts on air quality and health.  The results show that health impacts on Myanmar’s population are the third highest in Southeast Asia, after Indonesia and Vietnam [2].  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace says if all planned coal-fired power plants start to operate, Myanmar’s SO2 emissions from energy use would be projected to increase 7-fold, and NO2 to triple. The effect would be an increase in particulate matter and ozone pollution levels not just in Myanmar, but in other neighboring countries, putting even more people at risk to diseases such as stroke and lung cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The report projects that Myanmar’s coal power plant emissions would be responsible for a total of 7,100 premature deaths each year, or 280,000 premature deaths if these plants operate for 40 years. The air quality and health impacts are significantly exacerbated by the lack of effective regulation of air pollutant emissions from coal-fired power plants in Myanmar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Myanmar lacks meaningful emission standards for coal-fired power generation, which means air pollution from the planned projects are expected to around ten times higher than what would be allowed for example in China and India,” Lauri concluded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;ASEAN for a Fair, Ambitious and Binding Global Climate Deal (A-FAB)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the A-FAB? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ASEAN for a Fair, Ambitious and Binding Global Climate Deal (A-FAB) is a network that calls for a more active and transparent engagement of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set up by the coalition of Greenpeace, Oxfam and WWF, A-FAB aims to  sharpen and strengthen ASEAN’s position as a regional bloc at the UNFCCC  and as a community that collectively struggles to avert the impacts of  climate change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, it intends to complement ASEAN’s attempts  at ensuring the participation of its &lt;strong&gt;“community in the global  community,”&lt;/strong&gt; following the increasing processes which put its Charter at  work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate change and the ASEAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The  practical and political stakes of ASEAN in the climate negotiations are  high. ASEAN consists of countries which are considered vulnerable to sea  level rise, droughts, flooding, water scarcity and disasters, with its  extensive coastlines and location within the so called “ring of  fire.” Many of ASEAN’s 563 million are concentrated along the  coastlines. Many are also engaged in agricultural activities. Meanwhile,  about 150 million people in the region are considered working poor, who  could easily slide way below the poverty thresholds due to  disturbances. Sixty percent, mostly women, are engaged in the informal  economy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ASEAN in the UN climate talks and the A-FAB position&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This  April 3-8, 2011, Bangkok will be the venue of the United Nations  Climate Change Conference intersessional. A-FAB is urging the ASEAN to  convene a high-level meeting with the goal of strengthening the mandate  of ASEAN Working Group on Climate Change (AWGCC) and further opening  itself to the ASEAN community, including civil society. The AWGCC  established the ASEAN Climate Change Initiative (ACCI), a regional  consultative platform that is specifically meant to advance the region’s  interests in the negotiations around climate change. With such mandate,  it is hoped that ASEAN will articulate a more unified and stronger  position in COP 17 in Durban, South Africa later this year. The  high-level meeting comes at an opportune time given that host  Thailand is an ASEAN member state and ASEAN’s current chair Indonesia  has adopted the theme, &lt;strong&gt;“ASEAN community in the global community.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The  Bangkok intersessional has among its agenda adaptation, climate  finance, mitigation and technology transfer  mechanisms. A-FAB has  forwarded some policy recommendations for ASEAN in the Bangkok  intersessional. Among these is the assurance that the newly created  Adaptation Committee consists primarily of developing countries, follows  a country-driven and gender-sensitive approach in the development of  national adaptation policies and programs and is linked to financing  mechanisms. ASEAN must ensure that the adaptation gets much of the  resources in the new Green Climate Fund established in Cancun, as it is  more urgently needed by the majority of the poor population.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A-FAB  likewise urges ASEAN to push for the peaking of global emissions by  2015 and to demand a 25 to 40 percent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  reduction by developed countries by 2020, and at least a 95 percent cut  below 1990 levels by 2050. Another task is to decide on the most  accurate and appropriate measurable, reportable and verifiable (MRV)  instruments in ascertaining GHG emissions reduction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A-FAB  welcomes ASEAN’s earlier affirmation of the need for legally binding  agreements and the demand for scaled up and additional financial  resources from developed countries owing to the principles of historical  responsibility, as well as common but differentiated  responsibilities. A-FAB believes that such stance must be strengthened,  with key agreements struck by COP-17 in Durban, South Africa, on the  sources of climate finance to fill the new Climate Fund.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally,  as stakeholders in the ASEAN community, A-FAB urges ASEAN to take the  higher ground in responding to the real and urgent challenge of climate  change.&lt;/p&gt;

	Singapore—The Greenpeace flagship, the Rainbow Warrior has arrived in Singapore for environmental awareness, highlighting the need for ambitious climate action given the clear and present danger of climate change already affecting Singapore and other vulnerable countries in the region.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace is grateful for the opportunity to be here in Singapore with the Rainbow Warrior. She is a very special ship, traveling to remote parts of the world to put the spotlight on environmental and social issues that need actions and solutions. Most of all, the Rainbow Warrior stands in solidarity with the people who are fighting to reclaim their rights to a healthy and peaceful environment”, said Peter Willcox, Captain of the Rainbow Warrior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An icon of the seas, the Rainbow Warrior is known for her daring missions. Its first undertaking was to stop Iceland’s whaling programme back in 1978. Since then she has been on countless assignments and historic expeditions, both celebrated and controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 10 July 1985, while visiting New Zealand to confront French nuclear testing in the Mururoa Atoll, French secret service agents planted two bombs and sank the Rainbow Warrior resulting in the death of photographer Fernando Pereira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public outcry prompted a new ship to be commissioned and a second Rainbow Warrior returned to battle, successfully ending the French nuclear testing programs.  After 22 tireless years at the campaigning frontline, the ship retired from her Greenpeace life in August 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after, a third Rainbow Warrior was launched, built with sustainability in mind. The current ship is the first in the fleet designed and built specifically for Greenpeace.  It’s also one of the most energy-efficient ship in the high seas today, sailing primarily using wind power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior is now on a 5-month tour of Southeast Asia sailing to shed light on the causes, impacts, and solutions to mitigate climate change that is already affecting much of the region. In Singapore, the ship will promote Greenpeace’s vision of a green and peaceful future: where the climate is kept stable and the region's ancient forests and its inhabitants, are preserved and protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is fitting that the Rainbow Warrior is here in the Singapore especially as the government has marked 2018 as the Year of Climate Action. Now more than ever, we need more climate initiatives with ambitious targets set by the government for national implementation, with support from Singapore’s business sector,” said Naderev “Yeb” Saño, Executive Director for Greenpeace Southeast Asia. “Investments that are ecologically viable and sustainable are what the world needs right now. We hope to work closely with the Singapore government and civil society and we look forward to what the country can deliver under the Paris agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Phuket, 11 June 2018 – Grade 5 and 6 Thai students from Phuket and Phang Nga [1] showed off their culinary skills in a vegetarian cooking competition today in celebration of World Meat Free Day. The competition was among a series of activities organised by Greenpeace during the tour of their flagship, the Rainbow Warrior, in Thailand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This World Meat Free Day, Greenpeace offices around the world are calling on cities to reduce global meat and dairy consumption by introducing two plant-based meals a week in public institutions by 2020. The livestock industry releases as much greenhouse gases as all cars, trucks, planes and ships put together, globally[2]. If left unchecked, climate harming emissions from the livestock industry could undermine the success of the Paris Climate Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eating less meat and more vegetables has a positive impact both on our health and on the future of our planet,” said Watcharapol Daengsubha, Food and Ecological Agriculture Campaigner of Greenpeace Southeast Asia. “One of the primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions is from industrial meat production. In Thailand, Greenpeace is calling for the institution of a robust national sustainable food policy that promotes nutrition and is beneficial to the environment as well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every child needs and deserves healthy food. We hope that this activity can encourage children to eat more vegetables,” said Thai celebrity chef Pom Thanarak Chuto. “Thai cuisine is known around the world for its unique use of spices and the huge variety of nutrient-dense vegetables used. These already present a multitude of choices for schools and parents to provide healthy local fruits and vegetables that are beneficial for their children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chef Pom, Hettie Greenen, the Captain of the Rainbow Warrior, and Willie Ferrer, the chef of the Rainbow Warrior are the judges of the cooking contest that was held at the Phuket deep sea port. Other highlights during the event included the forum “VEG Talk: Less Meat, More Veggies.” The talk featured experts in food who discussed how the world's current food systems need to be improved, and Maria Poonlertlarp, Miss Universe Thailand 2017 who talked about how changing our diets can lead to good health and a healthier planet. Greenpeace is encouraging the public to tackle unhealthy food systems and to fight for a better future through our food choices, one bite at a time. [3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to&lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/publication/15093/less-is-more/"&gt;a recent report from Greenpeace International&lt;/a&gt;, global meat and dairy production and consumption must be halved by 2050 to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.[4] Changing our meat-intensive diets to more plant-based alternatives also provides many benefits to our health. Excessive consumption of red meat has been linked to cancer, heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. Plant-based diets, on the other hand, can reduce the risk of those diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Meat Free Day event is part of the “100% Renewable Energy for All" tour of the Rainbow Warrior in Thailand. The ship is in the country to highlight critical environmental issues. Greenpeace is working in solidarity with communities and with concerned citizens to celebrate people power and to call on policymakers to phase out coal and to champion solutions through an inclusive and sustainable economic development model based on just, affordable, and sustainable renewable energy systems.

	7 May, Bali, Indonesia - Major coal industry event Coaltrans started today in Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia, less than a week after the latest data from the World Health Organization showed that nine out of ten people are breathing air containing dangerous levels of pollutants.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“The rebound in the use of coal, oil and gas in 2017, which means not only increased CO2 emissions but also increased emissions of toxic air pollutants, risks people’s health and demands urgent action,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, Greenpeace Global Air Pollution Expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air pollution from coal-fired power plants in Southeast Asia is already responsible for 20,000 premature deaths a year. If planned coal projects go ahead that figure could rise to 70,000 from illnesses such as lung cancer, strokes and respiratory disease, according to research from Harvard University and Greenpeace International.[1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fossil fuel experts are expected to gather, network and secure deals at the industry event held at the luxurious US$500 a night Westin Resort on Bali, an island currently fighting its own battle with coal. Local community groups in Celukan Bawang on the northern coast are opposing the development of a coal-fired power plant they say is impacting the area’s biodiversity and destroying farming and fishing livelihoods.[2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Greenpeace Indonesia activists also protested the passage of coal barges through the Karimunjava national park in Java. Greenpeace research and testimonials show the barges damage coral and impact fisherfolk in the community.[3] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The health and livelihoods of Indonesian people is at risk and meanwhile the coal industry is meeting in Bali to make deals that secure its own future. This country doesn’t deserve a future built on coal, it’s time the government choose people over fossil fuels and urgently transition to renewables,” said Hindun Mulaika, Climate and Energy Campaigner from Greenpeace Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest data shows Jakarta’s ambient pollution (PM2.5) levels of 45ug/m3 exceed WHO guidelines by 3.5 times. Data is only available for Jakarta and Bandung, also highlighting a lack of monitoring and data disclosure in Indonesia. According to WHO, Austria reports data for more cities than all of Africa and Southeast Asia combined.[4] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Coal is a dying industry. Not only is global awareness of the health effects of air pollution at an all-time high, but major investors are shying away from putting their money into coal power plants in order to avoid investing in potentially stranded assets. They realise that the lifetime during which these plants will make money will be curtailed by future climate policy,” said Hindun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank, the biggest bank in Germany, has said it will &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/01/deutsche-bank-pulls-out-of-coal-projects-to-meet-paris-climate-pledge"&gt;stop financing coal projects&lt;/a&gt; as part of its commitments under the Paris agreement to tackle climate change. New construction of coal fired power plants fell 73% between 2015 and 2017, with China tightening restrictions and private finance leaving 17 construction sites abandoned in India.[5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Premature death in Asia caused by coal plant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal is responsible for over 800,000 premature deaths per year globally and many millions more serious and minor illnesses. (&lt;a href="https://endcoal.org/health/"&gt;https://endcoal.org/health/&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air pollution from coal-fired power plants in Southeast Asia is already responsible for 20,000 premature deaths a year. If planned coal projects go ahead that figure could rise to 70,000 from illnesses such as lung cancer, strokes and respiratory disease, according to new research from Harvard University and Greenpeace International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="A" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment in coal vs RE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment in coal-fired plants fell sharply, with nearly 20 gigawatts (GW) less commissioned, reflecting concerns about local air pollution and the emergence of overcapacity in some markets, notably China, though investment remained elevated in India. The investment decisions taken in 2016, totalling a mere 40 GW globally, signal a more dramatic slowdown ahead for coal power investment once the current wave of construction comes to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/publications/wei2017/"&gt;https://www.iea.org/publications/wei2017/&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renewable energy market continues to make remarkable progress. Last year was the eighth in a row that global investment in renewables exceeded US$200 billion. Much of this can be attributed to falling costs for solar electricity, and to some extent wind power, which continues to drive deployment. (&lt;a href="https://europa.eu/capacity4dev/unep/documents/global-trends-renewable-energy-investment-2018"&gt;https://europa.eu/capacity4dev/unep/documents/global-trends-renewable-energy-investment-2018&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="A" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divestment in coal in Europe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors may stop putting their money into coal power plants in order to avoid investing in potentially stranded assets. They shy away from investing in fossil fueled power plants as they realise that the lifetime during which these plants will make money will be curtailed by the future climate policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-        &lt;strong&gt;Deutsche Bank&lt;/strong&gt;, the biggest bank in Germany, has said it will stop financing coal projects as part of its commitments under the Paris agreement to tackle global warming. Existing exposure to such projects will be gradually reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/01/deutsche-bank-pulls-out-of-coal-projects-to-meet-paris-climate-pledge"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/01/deutsche-bank-pulls-out-of-coal-projects-to-meet-paris-climate-pledge&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-        &lt;strong&gt;Lloyd’s of London&lt;/strong&gt;, the world’s oldest insurance market, will start to exclude coal from its investment strategy from 1 April. (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/21/lloyds-of-london-to-divest-from-coal-over-climate-change"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/21/lloyds-of-london-to-divest-from-coal-over-climate-change&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-        German insurer Allianz, French investor Caisse des Dépôts, and French insurance corporation &lt;strong&gt;CNP Assurances&lt;/strong&gt; have all made big commitments, reducing the coal exposure of more than €865 billion of assets and potentially mobilising more than €20 billion into green sectors. &lt;strong&gt;Allianz&lt;/strong&gt;, which has annual revenue of €122 billion, announced it will no longer invest in mining companies and utilities that generate more than 30% of their sales or energy creation from coal. (&lt;a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/french-and-german-companies-pledge-massive-coal-divestment/"&gt;https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/french-and-german-companies-pledge-massive-coal-divestment/&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-        J.P. Morgan announced it would no longer finance new coal-powered plants in some wealthy nations (in 2016). (&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-07/jpmorgan-won-t-finance-new-coal-mines-that-worsen-climate-change"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-07/jpmorgan-won-t-finance-new-coal-mines-that-worsen-climate-change&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="A" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job creation in coal vs RE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising automation in extraction, overcapacity, industry consolidation, regional shifts, and the substitution of coal by natural gas in the power sector are resulting in job losses in the fossil-fuel sector in some countries. Moreover, climate policies and the rise of renewable energy may add pressure on the sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar PV has created the highest number of employment compared to other renewable energy sources, totalled to approximately 3.1 million jobs across the world. It is a 12 percent increase from its employment creation in 2015 and will continue to increase (IRENA, 2017). Solar PV creates as many as 10 jobs/MW, much higher than coal power that creates 1 job/MW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employment creation from renewable energy (2012-2016)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Barents Sea, Norway-- Eleven peaceful activists from the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise have taken to the water in inflatable boats with handheld banners to oppose the Statoil Songa Enabler oil rig, 275 km North off the Norwegian coast, in the Arctic Barents sea.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The banners say: “People Vs. Arctic Oil” and are directed at Statoil and the Norwegian government, which has opened a new, aggressive search for oil in the waters of the Barents Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change survivor and activist Joanna Sustento from the Philippines, and actress and activist Lucy Lawless from New Zealand, are among the 19 nationalities who have travelled to the high Northern waters onboard the Arctic Sunrise. Sustento wants the Norwegian government to take responsibility for its climate commitments and development of a new oil frontier in the Arctic. She lost her entire family, except for her brother, to Super-typhoon Haiyan in 2013 which left large parts of her hometown, Tacloban, in ruins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is hard for me to grasp and accept that a government like Norway’s is opening up new Arctic oil drilling, knowing full well it will put families and homes in other parts of the world at risk. I’m here in the Arctic to see this irresponsibility with my own eyes; share my story about the human consequences of climate change; and call on the Norwegian government to put a stop to this dangerous search for new oil,” said Sustento.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just two weeks after signing the Paris Climate Agreement, the Norwegian Government awarded 13 oil companies 10 new licenses in a completely new area, for the first time in more than 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is scary to think that super-typhoons could become the new normal if governments like Norway’s allow more oil drilling. I couldn't stop the typhoon that destroyed my home, but Norway could play a role in curbing the severity and frequency of these storms right now. It gives me hope to see that right now people are taking peaceful action for the climate all over the world and holding governments accountable,” added Sustento.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and the Norwegian organisation Nature and Youth, have also filed a lawsuit against the Norwegian government, arguing that the new oil licenses violate both the Paris Climate Agreement and paragraph 112 of the Norwegian Constitution, which commits the government “to safeguard the people’s right to a clean and healthy environment for future generations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 250,000 people have added their names to support the climate lawsuit, and these witness statements will be used to support the case in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can’t stand by, doing nothing, when we know beyond a doubt that we can’t burn a single barrel of oil from a new well if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe. I don’t ever want to look my kids in the eye and explain why I didn’t do all I could to protect them from climate change. It is beyond my understanding that the Norwegian government is giving Statoil a ticket to drill like mad at the expense of future generations,” said Lucy Lawless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Statoil rig Songa Enabler is currently looking for new oil at the Gemini North license, and is expected to continue to the Korpfjell license later this summer. Both licenses were awarded in the 23rd licensing round that is subject of the court case filed by Greenpeace and Nature and Youth, scheduled for hearing on November 14th, 2017. Statoil and the Norwegian government have decided to go ahead with the drillings despite the legal dispute.&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt; -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;ENDS-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, August 17-  This World Orangutan Day marks a critical time for the Bornean Orangutan, whose numbers are rapidly declining experts say. This is despite new claims from the Indonesian government that orangutan populations have increased by more than 10% between 2015-2017.[1]
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry says in a new report, ‘The state of Indonesia’s forests 2018’, that orangutan numbers have increased. This is at odds with the findings of a 41-strong team of scientists, led by Maria Voigt, who published their &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30086-1"&gt;peer-reviewed research&lt;/a&gt; in March. World Orangutan Day is this 19 August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Based on the life-history traits of orangutans, such a rapid growth rate isn’t possible - not even in zoos. From the most comprehensive compilation of observation data available to science, we estimated a 25-30% decline between 2005 and 2015. It is not likely that after one year there was a complete change in the situation,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maria Voigt of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team found that half of all Bornean Orangutans are impacted by resource extraction, and that their numbers fell by more than 100,000 over the sixteen years of the study from 1999 to 2015.[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If hunting and forest loss are halted in the future this decline could be reversed, but to the best of our knowledge that has not happened yet. It is therefore not clear how the authors of the report reached their conclusions about increases in orangutan numbers," said  Prof. Serge Wich at Liverpool John Moores University, leading co-author of the research, published in the journal Current Biology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A Greenpeace International investigation recently revealed an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/16846/over-1000-orangutans-threatened-by-illegal-operations-in-indonesia/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;illegal logging operation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in a critical peat landscape in Sungai Putri, West Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo - &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;home to one of the key remaining wild orangutan populations.[3] On the same site &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;in 2017, Indonesia’s Minister of Environment and Forestry instructed timber concession holder PT Mohairson Pawan Khatulistiwa (PT. MPK) to stop its operations and fill in a drainage canal which the company cut deep into the peat landscape. Photos taken by Greenpeace Indonesia in March 2018 revealed PT. MPK had failed to comply, and its machinery remained on site.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The government has promised to protect Indonesia’s remaining peatland forests and the orangutans that rely on them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It cannot let this kind of destruction continue, while at the same &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;time downplaying the harm to wildlife by releasing reports at odds with scientific evidence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The government must ensure and prioritise the full and permanent protection of the biodiversity of our forests,” said Ratri Kusumohartono, Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to figures released by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, around 24 million hectares of Indonesia’s forest was destroyed between 1990 and 2015 - an area almost the size of the UK.[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All three types of orangutan, the Bornean, Sumatran, and recently discovered Tapanuli species,[5] qualify as Critically Endangered according to the IUCN’s Red List.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;released this week a powerful new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://secure.greenpeace.org.uk/page/s/rang-tan-video"&gt;&lt;span&gt; 90-second animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; voiced by Emma Thompson that highlights how orangutans are being pushed to the brink of extinction because of deforestation for palm oil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, Indonesia – A new Greenpeace International investigation has revealed that Wilmar International, the world’s largest palm oil trader, is still linked to forest destruction for palm oil almost five years after committing to end deforestation.[1] 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;An area twice the size of Paris has been destroyed by Gama, a palm oil business run by senior Wilmar executives and members of their family. Photos and video taken by Greenpeace International on a recent flyover show active deforestation in two Gama concessions in Papua, Indonesia.[2]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Our investigation has exposed Wilmar’s dirty secret. For years, Wilmar and Gama have worked together, with Gama doing the dirty work so Wilmar’s hands stay clean. But now the truth is out, and Wilmar CEO Kuok Khoon Hong must act now to save his reputation. Wilmar must immediately cut off all palm oil suppliers that can’t prove they aren’t destroying rainforests,” said Kiki Taufik, the global head of Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s Indonesian forests campaign.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gama, one of Indonesia’s largest palm oil plantation companies, was set up by Wilmar’s co-founder, Martua Sitorus and his brother Ganda in 2011.[3] Gama’s concessions are owned and managed by members of Ganda’s and Martua Sitorus’s family, which includes Wilmar’s Country Head and Deputy Country Head for Indonesia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In December 2013, Wilmar became the first palm oil trader to publish a &lt;a href="http://www.wilmar-international.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/No-Deforestation-No-Peat-No-Exploitation-Policy.pdf"&gt;‘no deforestation, no peat, no exploitation’&lt;/a&gt; (NDPE) policy that applied in its own plantations and those of its suppliers. Mapping and satellite analysis shows that Gama destroyed 21,500ha of rainforest or peatland since Wilmar made its commitment [see report].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wilmar also has a history of evading responsibility for environmental and human rights abuses by selling off its most controversial concessions to Gama.[4]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wilmar’s General Manager with responsibility for trading within Indonesia, Darwin Indigo, is the son of Gama co-founder, Ganda, and also manages at least one Gama company. Darwin’s brother Andy Indigo manages Gama’s other concessions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Analysis of trade data shows that Wilmar continues to trade palm oil from Gama to many of the world’s biggest brands, despite being aware that Gama was violating Wilmar’s NDPE policy by clearing rainforest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Wilmar has been trading Gama’s oil all over the world, including to brands like P&amp;amp;G, Nestlé and Unilever. Brands cannot let this deception pass unchallenged, and have no choice but to suspend all business with Wilmar until it can prove it only trades clean palm oil from responsible producers,” said Kiki Taufik.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wilmar denies having any influence over Gama, although it admitted in a fax to Greenpeace International that Gama is run by Wilmar senior executives and members of their family.[5]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Southeast Asia’s plantation sector is notorious for using shell companies run by managers or family members to hide deforestation. Just last month, Greenpeace broke ties with Asia Pulp and Paper, Indonesia’s largest paper company, after &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/16535/greenpeace-slams-app-sinar-mas-over-links-to-deforestation-ends-all-engagement-with-company/"&gt;detecting deforestation&lt;/a&gt; in two concessions linked to APP and its parent company the Sinar Mas Group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wilmar is on the board of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), whose bi-annual conference kicks off on Monday in Paris. At least one Gama company, &lt;a href="https://rspo.org/members/6654/SG-BIOFUEL-PTE.-LTD"&gt;S&amp;amp;G Biofuel Ltd&lt;/a&gt;, is also an RSPO member. Under &lt;a href="https://www.rspo.org/publications/download/638ae27c7f6b004"&gt;RSPO membership rules&lt;/a&gt;, companies that share management or control should be treated as one group. This makes Wilmar responsible for what happens in Gama’s concessions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the RSPO to enforce its rules by requiring Wilmar and Gama to register as one group and suspending Wilmar until the rainforest Gama destroyed is restored.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[1] &lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/p4-production-content/international/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Report-GP_IND_Rogue_v6.1_Pages.pdf"&gt;Greenpeace investigation and satellite maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[2] Much of this deforestation has occured in just three of the concessions examined in Greenpeace’s report:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PT Graha Agro Nusantara (PT GAN), West Kalimantan, Kubu Raya district – 7,000ha of forest or peatland cleared since 2014&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    PT Agriprima Cipta Persada (PT ACP), Papua, Merauke district – at least 3,190ha of forest cleared since 2015&lt;br&gt;    PT Agrinusa Persada Mulia (PT APM), Papua, Merauke district – at least 2,500ha of forest cleared since January 2016.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[3]  Like many family-owned companies in Southeast Asia, Gama does not have a formal structure; instead, it is a network of plantations and palm oil companies owned, managed or controlled by Ganda and Martua Sitorus, and members of their family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Martua Sitorus is the co-founder of Wilmar and remains a board member. He is also &lt;a href="http://www.wilmar-international.com/who-we-are/board-of-directors/martua-sitorus/"&gt;CEO of Gama&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ganda’s and Martua Sitorus’s brother-in-law, Hendri Saksti is &lt;a href="http://www.wilmar-international.com/who-we-are/key-management-team/hendri-saksti/"&gt;Wilmar’s Country Head, Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. He also owns or manages Gama plantations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sitorus and Saksti’s nephew / Ganda’s son Darwin Indigo is &lt;a href="http://infopub.sgx.com/Apps?A=COW_CorpAnnouncement_Content&amp;amp;B=AnnouncementToday&amp;amp;F=V84SSG2YV04OSME1&amp;amp;H=81316f49e6515b54f772ba5d3768f830fbfcca2c134a69d4f5e06ccda84df8d6"&gt;Wilmar’s Deputy Country Head, Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. He also manages S&amp;amp;G Biofuel, a Gama joint venture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2004, &lt;a href="https://www.accountabilitycounsel.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Wilmar-complaint.pdf"&gt;Wilmar sold PT Jatimjaya Perkasa to Gama&lt;/a&gt; (then known as Ganda Group) following accusations of deforestation in the concession from Friends of the Earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2013, &lt;a href="https://rspo.org/members/complaints/status-of-complaints/view/1"&gt;Wilmar sold PT Asiatic Persada to Gama&lt;/a&gt; (then known as Ganda Group) following accusations of social conflict with local communities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2014, Wilmar sold PT Citra Riau Sirana to Gama, following &lt;a href="https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/publications/581/files/original/WWF_Indonesia_(25Jun13)_Palming_Off_a_National_Park_FINAL.pdf?1372252854"&gt;accusations from Eyes on the Forest / WWF&lt;/a&gt; of receiving fresh fruit bunches of oil palm from illegal plantations within Tesso Nilo national park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[5]  &lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/p4-production-content/international/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fax.pdf"&gt;Link to fax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photos and videos:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;https://media.greenpeace.org/collection/27MZIFJWLNTLJ&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contacts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sol Gosetti, International Communications Coordinator, Indonesia Forest, &lt;img class="obfimg Eoi_1" src="/seasia/Templates/Planet3/Styles/Images/emailimages/de5a74e5f7c33e92df880361fd2e5853.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

	&lt;p class="normal"&gt;There has been a huge increase in the number of fire hotspots across Indonesia in 2018. As many as 9,819 fire hotspots have been identified this year so far in West Kalimantan, nearly three times the number identified in all of 2017 (3,488).[2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;“People in Indonesia are sick and tired. The Indonesian government promised to crack down on rogue companies but the palm oil industry still isn’t listening. It’s early days yet and we hope the fires don’t get worse, but the haze is already &lt;a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/08/22/pontianak-steps-up-fight-against-forest-fires.html"&gt;shutting down schools&lt;/a&gt; and putting people’s lives at risk,” said Annisa Rahmawati, Forest Campaigner, Greenpeace Southeast Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;The number of fire hotspots has been growing throughout  August, with Indonesia’s Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) &lt;a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/08/23/water-bombing-helicopters-artificial-rain-deployed-to-fight-forest-fires-in-w-kalimantan.html"&gt;warning that the increasingly dry weather&lt;/a&gt; could see fires increase through September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;One of the concessions, PT Sumatera Unggul Makmur (PT SUM), has burned every year since 2013. It belongs to Gama, a palm oil company closely connected to the world’s largest palm oil trader, Wilmar.[3] Fire hotspots have also been recorded in concessions belonging to Bumitama and First Resources. All three producers have been supplying palm oil to major brands, including Mondelez, Nestlé and Unilever, via Wilmar and other palm oil traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;On Saturday, &lt;a href="https://en.tempo.co/read/news/2018/08/25/056921098/Court-Verdict-Jokowi-Guilty-in-Kalimantan-Forest-Fire"&gt;President Joko Widodo was found &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.tempo.co/read/news/2018/08/25/056921098/Court-Verdict-Jokowi-Guilty-in-Kalimantan-Forest-Fire"&gt;guilty &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.tempo.co/read/news/2018/08/25/056921098/Court-Verdict-Jokowi-Guilty-in-Kalimantan-Forest-Fire"&gt;of negligence&lt;/a&gt; by a Palangkaraya High Court in the government’s handling of the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/Press-Centre/Press-Releases/100300-deaths-from-Indonesias-fires-my/"&gt;deadly 2015 fires&lt;/a&gt;. The government is appealing the decision at the Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;“Instead of appealing this verdict, the government needs to accept it messed up and fix the problem by bringing the palm oil industry to heel. President Jokowi must take charge of the situation and enforce the law against companies that don’t protect their land from fire,” said Arie Rompas, one of the principal plaintiffs and forest campaign team leader of Greenpeace Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;Arif Setiawan from Rasau Jaya in West Kalimantan has been impacted by the fires every year since 2008, which is why he joined Greenpeace Indonesia’s Forest Fire Prevention team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;“2015 was the worst forest fires I’ve seen. Visibility was down to less than 10 meters, people had sore throats, sore eyes. Every hospital in Pontianak was full of cases of respiratory tract infections,” said Arif. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;“This year is also bad. Out on patrol, the peatlands are dry. When the wind blew we watched the fire engulf land and vegetation. We can smell the smoke as it spreads to Pontianak, it’s been thick in recent weeks, and my hometown is close to the hotspots so it’s even worse there. When it’s this bad children stay at home. The sad thing is people are getting used to living life wearing masks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	Manila - The Commission on Human Rights in the Philippines have called on 47 carbon producers to attend a preliminary meeting in its investigation into their corporate responsibility for climate-related human rights abuses (1). The companies include ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, Total, BHP Billiton, Suncor, and ConocoPhillips.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This is the first opportunity for the Filipino petitioners to meet representatives of the fossil fuel companies face-to-face. Though carbon producers might choose to ignore the request for their attendance, the preliminary conference is set to take place on 11 December, in which the petitioners and companies need to discuss and agree evidence submission and witness testimonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an unprecedented moment in the climate justice movement and especially for the thousands of typhoon survivors who are living with the impacts of climate change,” said Desiree Llanos Dee, Climate Justice campaigner for Greenpeace Southeast Asia in the Philippines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filipino typhoon survivors, other communities suffering the impacts of climate change, and civil society organizations, including Greenpeace Southeast Asia (Philippines), initially petitioned the Commission for the investigation in 2015 (2), two years after super-typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) claimed the lives of more than 6,300 people and affected millions of others who have yet to recover (3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission has full authority, based on its mandate under the Philippine Constitution, to investigate human rights harms in the Philippines, including impacts resulting from the companies’ global activities (4). So far, the companies have been using ‘courtroom tactics’ in an effort to avoid public scrutiny of their business activities that are contributing to human rights harms (5). Failure to attend the 11 December preliminary meeting would be a reflection of its lack of commitment to its corporate responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All the recent extreme weather events - from hurricanes in the US to monsoon flooding in South Asia - is not a coincidence. It’s the result of climate change,” said Llanos Dee. “A wave of climate justice cases are happening around the world, so while fossil fuel companies may try to run, they can’t hide. The science is clear: pollution from fossil fuel companies drives climate change, and this move by the Commission sends a strong signal around the world that those responsible for climate change will be held accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite knowing the severe risks posed by climate change for decades (6), the fossil fuel industry continues to drive climate change (7). The trend towards renewable energy is growing (8) and, with the Paris Agreement in force, a move towards an era free from fossil fuels is inevitable, along with a just transition for workers and communities affected by the industry’s downfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Philippines is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, and the petitioners will not back down,” said AG Saño, visual artist, activist, and one of the petitioners who survived super-typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We urge the CEOs of these major carbon producers to fully participate in the investigation, publicise their plans for stopping their use of fossil fuels, and explain how they intend to eliminate, remedy, or prevent human rights harms from climate change. Fossil fuels need to stay in the ground. After all we want to thrive and not just survive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many homes were destroyed during Typhoon Yolanda and people died - including some I knew,” said Isagani Serrano, president of the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement (PRRM), an organisation that provides support in the aftermath of disasters. “We hope these CEOs look deep in their hearts and see how their profit harms people and the planet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AG Saño will continue his advocacy for climate justice by representing the Filipino petitioners at COP 23 in Bonn in November.&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 4 July 2018:
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Martua Sitorus, the co-founder of the world’s largest palm oil trader, Wilmar International,&lt;a href="http://infopub.sgx.com/FileOpen/WIL%20announcement_Resignation%20of%20Non-Independent%20Non-Executive%20Director%20and%20Country%20Head%20of%20Indonesia_03.07.18.ashx?App=Announcement&amp;amp;FileID=512992"&gt; has resigned one week after Greenpeace exposed his links to Gama Plantation&lt;/a&gt;, a related palm oil business responsible for massive deforestation in Indonesia. His brother-in-law, Hendri Saksti, Wilmar’s Country Head for Indonesia and a manager of Gama companies, has also resigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/17248/worlds-largest-palm-oil-trader-linked-to-rainforest-destruction-twice-the-size-of-paris/"&gt;Greenpeace International investigation&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Gama, a palm oil business run by Sitorus, Saksti and members of their family, has destroyed an area of forest twice the size of Paris since 2013, when Wilmar committed &lt;a href="http://www.wilmar-international.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/No-Deforestation-No-Peat-No-Exploitation-Policy.pdf"&gt;to end its links to deforestation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to the news, Kiki Taufik, Global Head of Greenpeace’s Indonesia forests campaign said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This shows that Wilmar is determined to blame someone else for its failings. This is not just about Gama or Martua Sitorus. It’s about Wilmar’s refusal to do what it takes to keep forest destroyers out of its supply chain. If Wilmar is serious about reform, the first step is to prove its palm oil suppliers are clean by making them publish maps of all their concessions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on brands and traders to suspend business with Wilmar until it has addressed the violations of its ‘no deforestation, no peat, no exploitation’ policy, starting by publishing concession maps for all producer groups within its supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

	On this International Day for Biological Diversity, we want to show you stunning images from one of the world’s richest places in biodiversity: Indonesia. From whale sharks, to abundant coral reefs and forests teeming with life, the Greenpeace ship the Rainbow warrior is currently documenting the beauty and fragility of Indonesia’s natural environment.
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The message in these images is simple: this is what we stand to lose if we don’t act now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
If our planet is to sustain life on earth in the future and be protected from environmental destruction, we need action by governments to protect our living, breathing oceans and forests and to halt biodiversity loss.
&lt;p&gt;The fragile state of Indonesia's oceans and forests are a clear reminder of how marine and forest life is at risk from industrial overfishing and relentless deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="events-box big-box left"&gt;

Indonesia has at least 20% of the world’s total biodiversity and is home to more than 30,000 recorded species of plants and more than 3,000 mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Approximately 10% of the world’s rainforests are located in Indonesia. Fifty years ago, 82% of the country was covered with forests but in the last decade this has dropped to 48% due to relentless deforestation for paper and palm oil plantations and mining.
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s seas are also among the most diverse coastal and marine habitats. Areas like Raja Ampat, in West Papua, are claimed to be among the richest spots in biodiversity on Earth. But the country’s coral reefs are considered to be among the world’s most threatened biodiversity hotspots, at risk from overfishing, pollution and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="events-box big-box left"&gt;
&lt;div class="frame"&gt;&lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" title="" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/Global/international/photos/forests/2013/Indonesia%20Forests/GP04L6X.jpg"&gt; &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_epiEntryContent_ctl00_ctl10_Image1" class="Thumbnail" style="border-width: 0px;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/ReSizes/Large/Global/international/photos/forests/2013/Indonesia%20Forests/GP04L6X.jpg" alt=""&gt; &lt;span class="btn-open"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Continued inaction is not an option.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must move now to stop destructive industrial overfishing in order to restore our oceans to health and take steps to achieve zero deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;

	Bangkok, Thailand - Strung along the coast of southern Thailand is a line of small fishing towns, nestled between the rugged beauty of the Tanaosri Mountains and the once-abundant waters of the Gulf of Thailand. For centuries, the people of Prachuabkirikhan ["the city in the mountains"] have enjoyed a simple lifestyle of hard work, living from the riches of the ocean and their farmlands.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://aljazeera.galleries.newscred.com/gallery_slideshow/22679362017dc959c66f9faa575ec7f6?width=640&amp;amp;disable_link_to_hosted_page=1&amp;amp;height=430&amp;amp;show_related=0#" width="684" height="455"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this idyllic existence - which attracts tourists looking for a laid-back beach holiday far from the bars and nightclubs of the big resort towns - may soon vanish as the province is hammered on two fronts, by climate change and rampant overfishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The times are changing too fast for Niwat Chaloemwong, and he fears for the future of his community. To say that fishing is encoded in his DNA would be trite; Chaloemwong joined the crew of a small local fishing boat at the age of 12 and spent the next 40 years supporting his family from the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When I started fishing, there were so many sharks and stingrays in this bay. There were many kinds of fish that we used to catch, but now we don't see them at all any more." He traces the dramatic drop in the catch by ordinary fishermen to the proliferation of commercial trawlers in the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I first saw those trawlers come to this bay about 20 years ago. When they come, they dredge everything away; even the fish spawn, because the mesh they use is so fine. This is dangerous because it means the fish can't breed and can become extinct."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trawlers - fishing boats that pull huge nets through the water, sometimes dragging the nets across the sea floor - make up just 13 percent of the fishing vessels in Thailand, but are responsible for more than half of the country's catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For some small fishermen, the catch has dropped by half. I think this is because the trawlers take too many fish and don't leave enough for the community," says Chaloemwong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt is a constant worry for artisan fishermen, for whom a storm or a bad season can spell financial disaster. Angsada Klanphaitoon, a small-scale fisherman from Khao Deng, says the commercial trawlers that flock the Gulf have made their lives even harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These ships have big nets that drag along the sea bed and take everything," he told Al Jazeera. "They even take the baby fish, which means there is less for us to catch, as they are taking the next generation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do the trawlers indiscriminately suck marine life out of the ocean, they can also drag away the nets put out by small fishermen. "Last year it cost me 15,000 Thai baht ($480) to replace my nets after they got caught up by the trawl nets," said Klanphaitoon. "This is the third time this has happened to me."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way for him to replace the nets is by getting a loan. If the nets vanish again before he has paid off the loan, he is in danger of spiralling into debt he cannot get out of, particularly as there is no guarantee he will get good catches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem destruction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We go out for squid at night, but my father says there is a lot less to catch than in his day," said Klanphaitoon. "The shrimp farms release polluted water into the sea and this drives the squid away."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shoreline is dotted with shrimp farms, many owned by a massive Thai supermarket chain, feeding the demand for shrimp both locally and abroad. Many rice paddies have been converted into shrimp farms, and the mangroves - which are vital for the coastal ecosystem - have been destroyed, reportedly by effluent from the farms, which includes antibiotics and fertiliser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angsada's mother, Thongpoon Klanphaitoon, says the loss of the mangroves also creates a physical danger. "I notice that the weather is less predictable than when I was young, and the storms are bigger and come more often," she said. "If the storm comes from the west, where we still have our mangroves, then it won't be so bad. But on our northeast side, the owner of the shrimp farm has removed the mangrove, so when the storm comes from that direction it hits us very hard."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaloemwong points out that many fishing families have had to adapt to the declining catch by modifying their small boats and focusing on catching squid and crabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They just can't catch enough other kinds of fish anymore. If this continues, everybody will be in trouble in this community."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is also deeply worried about how he has seen the climate change during his own lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the past, the seasons were well-defined, but now there is no winter and the summers are even hotter," he noted. Chaloemwong's sister is a pineapple farmer - one of the staple crops of the area - and he says his family has noticed that the heat is making it harder for people to work long hours during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now the children are getting sick from the heat, the adults are getting tired more quickly and people have to shower three times a day, just to keep going."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of global warming on the oceans is more obvious to him, a change that has happened rapidly and recently. "We have noticed that the seawater is getting much warmer," he said. "When the water is hot, all the decaying matter on the ocean floor floats to the surface and creates a bloom of algae. This blocks the oxygen from the water and the fish can't breathe any more, because the water is rotten. That algae is very slimy and it coats our nets, so when we try pull them in, they slip out of our hands."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Chaloemwong's seafaring trips are over, he is still an integral part of the fishing community and shares their worries for the future. "Many fishermen have already had to quit because they have to take loans to pay for boats and equipment, but then when they can't catch enough fish, they can't repay the loans and they have to sell their boats."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With both agriculture and fishing under threat, he is uncertain about how the community will survive. The one thing he is sure of is that humans are at the heart of these problems: "When I was young, we took only what we needed. The problem is that now there is no more balance between humans and nature."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a nearby pier, fleets of bottom-trawlers disgorge their catch. Men in plastic boots and cowboy hats quickly sort the haul, separating the fish to be packed on ice and sold to big processing companies from the discarded bycatch and so-called "trash fish". These trash fish make up as much as 60 percent of the trawlers' catch, and about 30 percent of these trash fish are juveniles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bycatch is particularly poignant; stingrays and sharks flapping across the deck, masses of juvenile fish and fish roe entangled in the mesh of the weighted nets. These fish aren't the intended target of the trawlers, but are dragged aboard in the nets anyway. Trash fish are those that can't be sold for food, so are destined to be mashed into a fish pulp, dried and turned into pellets to feed farmed prawns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quay is slick with a mosaic of tiny discarded fish, a grim reminder of the toll these trawlers are extracting, not just on the oceans but on the lives of fishing communities. After the refrigerated trucks have been loaded, a crew member turns a high-pressure hose onto the deck and nets, blasting away any small fish that remain, and with them a vital part of the ocean life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, June 20, 2013 – Half of the fire hotspots detected between June 11-18 that are choking Singapore and Malaysia with air pollution are in areas that should be protected by Indonesia’s forest moratorium, Greenpeace has revealed. 
&lt;div&gt;
	

“The fact these fires continue to affect the region shows just how poorly forest protection measures are enforced in Indonesia. But corporations must also take responsibility for their supply chains, commit to zero deforestation and stop the sort of illegal practices such as fire clearing that is destroying our forests and clogging our air," said Yuyun Indradi, Forest Campaigner for Greenpeace Southeast Asia.

More than 10 million hectares of primary forests and around 32 million hectares of secondary forests still don't have any legal protection in Indonesia, according to Greenpeace International’s analysis of the government’s recent revision of its moratorium map (PIPIB) data.

“With each revision the amount of forest legally protected under the moratorium is reduced – more than six million hectares has been lost since 2011. President SBY recently told Greenpeace he will do more to strengthen environmental protection, but the reduction in protected forest signals a weakening rather than a strengthening of forest protection,” Yuyun said.

More than 600,000 hectares of peatland and primary and secondary forest – rich carbon stores that if destroyed would contribute greatly to Indonesia’s massive greenhouse gas emissions – have been excluded from the latest moratorium map.

The lack of updated data and transparency creates confusion around what forest is actually protected under the moratorium. Based on best available data, the forest moratorium overlaps with 5.5 million hectares that have been granted as concession areas for development to pulp wood or oil palm plantations, selective logging or mining.

The government must review existing concessions, increase transparency in the way licenses are granted, establish a credible database of low carbon land as an alternative to the current destruction of high carbon land and undertake clear spatial and land use planning.

	Manila / San Francisco - Typhoon Mangkhut, one of the strongest storms of the year, is forecast to hit the north of the Philippines by the weekend before threatening Hong Kong and Macau. In the Atlantic, Hurricane Florence made landfall on the US east coast on Friday and is growing larger. Although its wind speed has decreased, Florence is still expected to pour record rains through Monday.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Speaking from the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS) in San Francisco, Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have arrived at the moment of truth. Climate change is here and it’s big and dangerous. Typhoon Mangkhut and Hurricane Florence are the latest grim examples of the dangers the changing climate might pose. But let’s not forget there is still hope, and the IPCC’s special report on 1.5 degrees must guide our response. The question is, who will take up the reigns of climate leadership and take the action that’s needed? We have no time to waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is critical that this summit sends a powerful signal about what climate leadership, in 2018, truly means. Our climate is changing and the future dangers scientists warned us about are here and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve lost precious time through denial and insufficient action from political leaders and companies and we’re now running up against the clock. We’re at the 11th hour and in urgent need for climate leadership and action before it truly is too late.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Southeast Asia Executive Director Yeb Sano said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Typhoon Mangkhut is again a severe CAT5 storm eerily close to the force of Haiyan, forecast to hit the country's top rice and corn producing provinces at a time when rice harvest has barely started, and when the country is already reeling from rice shortages. Fiercer and fiercer storms and droughts threaten us now yearly. Running away from storms, counting the dead, picking up the pieces, rising from the rubble, rebuilding homes, and rehabilitation of communities have become a way of life for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But we refuse to accept this, and our Climate Justice and Human Rights [1] case against the big polluters is our way of telling the world that we will not take this injustice sitting down, the fossil fuel industry can never hide. Those least responsible for climate change suffer its worst impacts, while the fossil fuel industry remains wealthy, powerful, and unaccountable. Inaction has led to this situation, and unfortunately, nations have not come anywhere near the promises they made in Paris. Justice must be served.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace USA Executive Director Annie Leonard said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hurricane Florence is expected to pour record rains on the Southeast coast of the United States as this Global Action Climate Summit unfolds in California. It’s a stern reminder for our elected officials that to show real leadership on climate, they need to implement plans for a just and managed transition off fossil fuels now. Trump has consistently left communities impacted by major hurricanes to fend for themselves. It’s time to hold him and other climate denying politicians accountable for the unwillingness to take action in favor of our communities.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Manila, Philippines – Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestlé were the most frequent companies identified in 239 cleanups and brand audits spanning 42 countries and six continents, the Break Free From Plastic movement announced today. Over 187,000 pieces of plastic trash were audited, identifying thousands of brands whose packaging relies on the single-use plastics that pollute our oceans and waterways globally. Coca-Cola was the top polluter in the global audit, with Coke-branded plastic pollution found in 40 of the 42 participating countries. This brand audit effort is the most comprehensive snapshot of the worst plastic polluting companies around the world. 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“These brand audits offer undeniable proof of the role that corporations play in perpetuating the global plastic pollution crisis,” said Global Coordinator of Break Free From Plastic Von Hernandez. “By continuing to churn out problematic and unrecyclable throwaway plastic packaging for their products, these companies are guilty of trashing the planet on a massive scale. It’s time they own up and stop shifting the blame to citizens for their wasteful and polluting products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audits, led by Break Free From Plastic member organizations[1], found that Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestlé, Danone, Mondelez International, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, Unilever, Perfetti van Melle, Mars Incorporated, and Colgate-Palmolive were the most frequent multinational brands collected in cleanups, in that order. This ranking of multinational companies included only brands that were found in at least ten of the 42 participating countries. Overall, polystyrene, which is not recyclable in most locations, was the most common type of plastic found, followed closely by PET, a material used in bottles, containers, and other packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top polluters in Asia, according to the analysis, were Coca-Cola, Perfetti van Melle, and Mondelez International brands. These brands accounted for 30 percent of all branded plastic pollution counted by volunteers across Asia. This year’s brand audits throughout Asia build upon a week-long cleanup and audit at the Philippines’ Freedom Island in 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/7621/nestle-unilever-pg-among-worst-offenders-for-plastic-pollution-in-philippines-in-beach-audit/"&gt;which found Nestlé and Unilever to be the top polluters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We pay the price for multinational companies' reliance on cheap throwaway plastic,” said Greenpeace Southeast Asia - Philippines Campaigner Abigail Aguilar. “We are the ones forced to clean up their plastic pollution in our streets and waterways. In the Philippines, we can clean entire beaches and the next day they are just as polluted with plastics. Through brand audits, we can name some of the worst polluters and demand that they stop producing plastic to begin with."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In North and South America, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestlé brands were the top polluters identified, accounting for 64 and 70 percent of all the branded plastic pollution, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In Latin America, brand audits put responsibility on the companies that produce useless plastics and the governments that allow corporations to place the burden, from extraction to disposal, in mostly vulnerable and poor communities,” said GAIA Coordinator for Latin America Magdalena Donoso. “BFFP members in Latin America are exposing this crisis  and promoting zero waste strategies in connection with our communities."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestlé brands were again the top identified polluters, accounting for 45 percent of the plastic pollution found in the audits there. In Australia, 7-Eleven, Coca-Cola, and McDonald’s brands were the top polluters identified, accounting for 82 percent of the plastic pollution found. And finally, in Africa, ASAS Group, Coca-Cola, and Procter &amp;amp; Gamble brands were the top brands collected, accounting for 74 percent of the plastic pollution there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“These brand audits are putting responsibility back where it belongs, with the corporations producing endless amounts of plastics that end up in the Indian Ocean,” said Griffins Ochieng, Programmes Coordinator for the Centre for Environment Justice and Development in Kenya. “We held cleanups and brand audits in two locations in Kenya to identify the worst corporate polluters in the region and hold them accountable. It is more urgent than ever, for the sake of communities that rely on the ocean for their livelihoods, health and well-being, to break free from plastic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/"&gt;Break Free From Plastic&lt;/a&gt; is calling on corporations to reduce their use of single-use plastic, redesign delivery systems to minimize or eliminate packaging, and take responsibility for the plastic pollution they are pumping into already strained waste management systems and the environment. While the brand audits do not provide a complete picture of companies’ plastic pollution footprints, they are the best indication to date of the worst plastic polluters globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] Break Free From Plastic is a global movement envisioning a future free from plastic pollution. Since its launch in September 2016, nearly 1,300 groups from across the world have joined the movement to demand massive reductions in single-use plastics and to push for lasting solutions to the plastic pollution crisis. These organizations share the common values of environmental protection and social justice, which guide their work at the community level and represent a global, unified vision. &lt;a href="http://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/"&gt;www.breakfreefromplastic.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	JAKARTA. Greenpeace recognizes the new IOI Loders Croklaan Sustainable Palm Oil Policy as another sign of the shift that is happening within the industry, but regards the announcement as a missed opportunity for the IOI Group to join the ranks of the most progressive companies. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;While palm oil processor IOI Loders Croklaan has committed to No Deforestation and to going beyond RSPO standards by protecting High Carbon Stock forests, unfortunately, Croklaan's parent company IOI Group has not extended the commitment to cover oil palm plantations under its control and in its supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy applies to all IOI Loders Croklaan processing operations, its subsidiaries, joint ventures and companies in which it has management control, along with all its suppliers of palm oil. However, it does not cover oil palm plantations operated by the parent company, its joint ventures, or independent suppliers of fresh fruit bunches to be processed by the IOI Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up till June this year there have been reports of the IOI Group clearing forested peat lands for oil palm plantations. Recently the IOI Group, though its membership of the Sustainable Palm Oil Manifesto, announced a temporary halt of all clearance of potential HCS areas in its own plantations, but that commitment does not extend to their third party suppliers. In addition, the group has not clarified how potential HCS is defined and how the policy will be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although IOI holds the power to speed up the transition to responsible palm oil, the group has missed an opportunity to step forward and commit to a  more comprehensive policy across its supply chain. The IOI Group has invested in a number of joint ventures and shareholdings in palm oil producers, for example a 31.4 percent stake in Bumitama Agri ltd, which has Indonesian plantings spanning almost twice the area of Singapore. IOI’s sustainability commitment must cover such investments and operations. IOI needs to step up and follow the example set by other companies in the industry like Wilmar and Cargill that have made more ambitious commitments,” said Annisa Rahmawati of Greenpeace SEA’s Indonesia office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is time for the IOI Group to commit to, and implement a No Deforestation policy at the group level. The IOI Group must heed the public demand for deforestation-free palm oil products in their shopping baskets.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Given growing public concern about the impact of deforestation on the climate, wildlife and forest communities, scores of international consumer companies have commitments to use deforestation-free palm oil. Producer companies such as Golden Agri Resources that wish to take advantage of this new market must move faster to make good on their promises, according to Greenpeace spokesperson Wirendro Sumargo.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;GAR, the world’s second-largest palm oil company and the first to commit to a comprehensive Forest Conservation Policy (FCP) back in 2011, announced Q3 results yesterday. However, unresolved social and environmental issues show that the company needs to step up the speed and quality of its FCP implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) complaint lodged last month by Forest Peoples Programme shows that GAR is struggling with implementation of basic social safeguards in its Indonesian operations. Failure to ensure the proper implementation of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) as a tool for the recognition of customary lands is a cause for serious concern. Greenpeace strongly encourages GAR to deal with the crucial issues outlined in the RSPO complaint. Beyond that, it needs to more rapidly and fully implement its Forest Conservation Policy,” said Wirendro in Jakarta today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="Standard"&gt;In Liberia, GAR also faces unresolved RSPO complaints against Golden Veroleum Liberia (GVL), in which GAR holds a commanding share. GVL needs to strenghten significantly FPIC implementation to address current social conflicts and divisions between communities, and prevent further problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides its own concessions, GAR sources fresh fruit bunches and crude palm oil from third parties for milling and refining at its own facilities. In February this year GAR announced that its FCP would also apply to this supply from third parties. However a report released this week by the Rainforest Action Network on threats to Sumatra's internationally significant Leuser Ecosystem shows that GAR is exposed to the risk of sourcing from suppliers linked to the destruction of the forests and peatlands in the Leuser Ecosystem, critical habitat for Sumatran tigers, orang-utans, rhinos, sunbears and other endangered species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace urges GAR to respond to these serious reports as a matter of urgency. The company must take immediate action to ensure that no palm oil connected to either social conflict or environmental damage is entering its supply chain. GAR needs to make public its action plan outlining clearly how its third party supply chain from areas such as the unique and irreplaceable Leuser Ecosystem will be kept deforestation free,” Wirendro said.&lt;/p&gt;

	New Palm Oil Sustainability Policy Won’t Halt Forest Clearing by Pulp and Paper arms of RGE
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;RGE Group’s oil palm plantation company Asian Agri and palm oil trading arm Apical have announced new sustainability policies that aim to tackle the impact the companies have on Indonesia’s forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bustar Maitar, head of Greenpeace’s Indonesian Forests Campaign, said that while he welcomes the announcement, he sees it as a missed opportunity by the RGE Group to address all of its impacts on the rainforests of Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday’s announcement of new commitments by Asian Agri and Apical, palm oil businesses owned by Sukanto Tanoto, comes as his family’s pulp companies, including APRIL and Toba Pulp Lestari, continue to destroy Indonesia’s rainforests. In Pulau Padang, Sumatra, bulldozers are right this moment continuing to clear forests on deep peatland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We note the announcement of new commitments by Asian Agri and Apical, but why are RGE’s pulp companies, including APRIL and Toba Pulp Lestari, allowed to continue with deforestation? Questions also remain about how these new palm oil policies will apply to minority shareholdings, third party suppliers and new acquisitions,” said Bustar in Jakarta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace calls on RGE to immediately implement No Deforestation commitments that apply to all pulp and palm oil businesses that are owned or controlled by the Tanoto family, and to support conservation initiatives on a scale that matches the group’s previous responsibility for deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;

	The HCS Approach is being developed as a tool to help companies and other stakeholders implement commitments to end deforestation. It builds on the methodology developed by Golden Agri Resources, Greenpeace and TFT since 2011. It aims to provide a practical and credible way to identify degraded areas suitable for potential plantation development and forest areas that merit protection to maintain and enhance carbon, biodiversity and social values. In practice, the approach integrates HCS assessments with High Conservation Value (HCV) assessments, the protection of peat lands, processes to accommodate local communities’ livelihoods and aspirations, and respect for the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities to give or withhold their free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) to proposed developments that may affect their lands. 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is the HCS Approach used to implement No Deforestation commitments? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last year has seen an increasing number of producer and consumer companies make commitments to break the link between palm oil and and negative environmental and social impacts, including deforestation. Various consumer companies including Mars, Nestle, Colgate Palmolive and Unilever, refer to the HCS methodology in their responsible sourcing policies.  Protection of HCV areas and HCS forests, in combination with upholding human and workers rights, including obtaining FPIC for any new developments has become the basis of a No Deforestation commitment. To ensure its credibility it is crucial that companies cease all vegetation clearance while these assessments are taking place by credible assesors and community consent is sought, similar to the proper implementation of the New Plantings Procedure under Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is the HCS Approach needed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As NGOs, we have seen that measures to protect forests under the current RSPO standard are not strict and robust enough. High Conservation Value assessments generally do not lead to the conservation and restoration of the majority of secondary or degraded forests inside the concession. The HCS methodology was developed as a tool to identify and protect forested areas in addition to HCV assessments and respecting FPIC, which are mandatory under RSPO. We encourage the RSPO to further strenghten its principles and criteria to include the protection of HCS forests. Until the RSPO is able to deliver physically certified and deforestation free palm oil, companies can use the Charter of the Palm Oil Innovation Group to obtain third party verification of their commitments to protect HCS forests under a No Deforestation commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the HCS Approach Steering Group?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multi-stakeholder body called the HCS Steering Group was recently set up to oversee and govern the HCS Approach. The group will lead a process for further development and global standardisation of the HCS methodology. This includes seeking reviews and advice from a science committee and expert guidance based on a range of field trials. In addition to standardisation, to assist its widespread adoption, the Steering Group will develop a process to ensure quality control of the use of the methodology.  Furthermore, a ‘Consultation Forum’ is being established to inform and receive feedback from key stakeholder groups including consumer companies, governments, community organisation, as well as coordinate with institutions including the RSPO, Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the High Conservation Value Resource Network. It will reach out to other parties developing thinking and practice on HCS assessments. While the starting point for HCS was in the palm oil industry, this tool can also be useful for different plantation industries. The HCS Steering Group intends to further develop a cross-commodity approach to identifying and protecting HCS forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is involved in the HCS Approach Steering Group?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial Steering Group is comprised of the following organisations: Forest Peoples Programme (FPP), Greenpeace and WWF; plantation companies: Agropalma, Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), Golden Agri-Resources (GAR) and Wilmar and the technical support company TFT.  The Steering Group invites all relevant stakeholders to participate in this credible multi-stakeholder forum.  Consumer companies Unilever, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble and Nestle have expressed support and interest to engage in this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the difference between the HCS Approach Steering Group and the Sustainable Palm Oil Manifesto's High Carbon Study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study on High Carbon Stock has been initiated by the Sustainable Palm Oil Manifesto  (SPOM) group. As NGOs we do not support the Sustainable Palm Oil Manifesto as it falls short of the new benchmarks for responsible palm oil production and trade. We are not involved with the SPOM Steering Committee and this committee is currently not a multistakeholder driven initiative. However, we are looking forward to the results of their HCS study, and hope that its findings will further strengthen the HCS Approach as it is currently implemented by various other companies. The HCS Approach is a tool to put in practice commitments to break the link between palm oil and deforestation. The HCS Approach Steering Group will consider any recommendations from the HCS Study that will contribute to this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A important element of the HCS Approach is that companies stop the clearance of forested areas while HCS assessments are carried out to identify areas for conservation and what can potentially be developed. While the SPOM companies initially were hesitant to commit to this, their recent announcement to temporarily halt the clearance of potential HCS is a good first step. Uncertainly remains on how they define ‘potential HCS forests.’ We urge the SPOM companies to adopt strong social and environmental safeguards for all the palm oil they use through their supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

	APRIL and other Royal Golden Eagle group pulp companies “are greatest threat to Indonesia’s rainforests” says Greenpeace
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jakarta, 28 Jan 2015: One year on from its announcement of a new forest protection policy, Asia Pacific Resources International Limited (APRIL) now presents the greatest single threat facing Indonesia's forests.[1] Over the last year, the company has pulped tens of thousands of hectares of rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APRIL’s policy sees forest clearance to feed its mills continuing up to 2020 and makes no commitment to end peatland development. By contrast, its largest competitor, Asia Pulp &amp;amp; Paper, stopped clearing forests two years ago, and fellow Royal Golden Eagle group company, palm oil giant Asian Agri, committed to full forest and peatland protection last September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APRIL’s Sustainable Forest Management Plan, launched January 28, 2014, includes a commitment to only clear forest that is not of "high conservation value" (HCV), based on independent assessments peer reviewed by the High Conservation Value Resource Network.[2] Yet a December 2014 report by KPMG, commissioned by APRIL’s own Stakeholder Advisory Committee, found that not one of the 50 concessions supplying APRIL with fibre complied with this new policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, investigations by Greenpeace and other NGOs in Indonesia, confirmed by KPMG findings, show extensive forest clearance throughout APRIL’s supply chain in 2014. KPMG found that in the first six months of 2014 alone, APRIL’s pulp mill in Kerinci, Sumatra consumed 1.3 million cubic metres of rainforest timber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In early November, Greenpeace documented an APRIL subsidiary clearing large areas of dense forest and cutting drainage canals into fire-prone peatland on Padang island in Riau, Sumatra.[3] Much of the forest in this concession is known to be on deep peat. Deep peat is protected under an Indonesian presidential decree, and clearance of forest on deep peat violates Ministry of Forestry regulations.[4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that month, on Nov. 27, Indonesian President Joko Widodo witnessed from the air the destruction of Padang island. While personally assisting in damming a peat drainage canal dug by another APRIL supplier at nearby Tebing Tinggi island, the President pledged to review and cancel concessions where plantation companies were damaging peatlands.[5] However, despite APRIL committing to end forest destruction in its concessions by December 2014, Padang island residents documented further peatland clearance by the company in January 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, satellite analysis shows that during 2014 APRIL supplier Adindo Hutani Lestari in North Kalimantan cleared around 27,000 hectares of dense peatland forest as well as other forest areas, including areas originally mapped by the company’s own assessors as HCV. At least 4,500 hectares of this was located on deep peat. [6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“APRIL thought it could buy time for continued forest and peatland destruction with this weak forest policy. It has spent the past twelve months destroying as much forest as possible. But its attempts at greenwash have failed spectacularly. Even its own consultants are exposing APRIL’s lack of progress and broken promises,” said Zulfahmi, forest campaign team leader at Greenpeace Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Other companies have realised that deforestation has to stop, yet APRIL and its stablemates in the Royal Golden Eagle group seem determined to keep pulping rainforest. APRIL, Asia Symbol, Sateri and Toba Pulp Lestari are the greatest threat that Indonesia’s rainforests face today. Companies that buy from APRIL, or banks like Santander and ABN Amro that are financing APRIL’s operations, should take their business elsewhere if they want to avoid being associated with this destruction,” said Richard George, global forest campaigner at Greenpeace UK.&lt;/p&gt;

	When Golden Agri-Resources (GAR) announced its ambitious Forest Conservation Policy (FCP) in early 2011, it aimed to position the company as an industry leader. GAR has collaborated with The Forest Trust to implement its FCP and to move towards responsible palm oil practices. Greenpeace has helped to develop the methodology used and to monitor progress. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;To support transparency, the findings from Greenpeace’s assessment of GAR’s progress to date are presented in ‘&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Forests-Reports/GAR-Progress-Report/"&gt;Golden Agri Resources - A Progress Report&lt;/a&gt;’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three and half years, the record in Indonesia and Liberia is mixed. Nonetheless, important progress has been made to end deforestation within GAR’s supply chain. As a result of the company’s policy, a method has been developed to identify forest for conservation. Known as the High Carbon Stock (HCS) Approach, this is now being adopted across the palm oil sector and beyond. However, GAR still has much work to do if it is to ensure that its palm oil is truly responsible. This must include urgent action to improve social performance – ensuring Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) and conflict resolution in dealings with local communities. There is also a need to make additional progress in the quality of HCV assessment, in transparency, and in the application of responsible practices across its supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “GAR has played a pioneering role in developing a ‘No Deforestation’ policy. All the same, it still has much work to do in putting environmentally responsible palm oil practices into action. This isn’t only science and economics – the social aspect is crucial to the success of any conservation policy. GAR must therefore transform its relationship with local communities. Their rights and livelihoods have to be respected, as part of a process of incentives and partnerships intended to achieve the long-term conservation of HCS forests,” said Greenpeace Indonesia’s Bustar Maitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “GAR should join other companies in pressing for the transformation of the industry through the introduction of appropriate legislation. Specifically, and in line with its recent KADIN pledge, GAR and the other signatories need to urge full legal protection for peatlands and HCS/HCV forests.”&lt;/p&gt;

	On Friday, 27 February 2015 Mr Indra Pelani, a resident of Lubuk Mandarsah village in Tebo district, Jambi and a member of the Sakato Jaya Farmers’ Association, was found dead following an incident apparently involving seven security officers employed by a security firm contracted by Wira Karya Sakti (WKS), a company owned by Asia Pulp &amp; Paper (APP).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is deeply saddened by the news of the brutal death. Greenpeace condemns such acts of violence. We stand in solidarity with the community and Indra’s family at this difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace’s global head of the Indonesia forest campaign, Bustar Maitar said,“Given the gravity of this incident, the conflict resolution process must be prioritised on this case and across all APP operations in order to ensure justice is delivered. In the interim, Greenpeace will step back from other engagement with APP to focus on addressing the serious issues highlighted by this case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continued: “Following a fair and comprehensive investigation,  those directly and indirectly responsible for Indra’s death, including members of the security firm and APP, must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law if found to have been connected to this tragic death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added: “APP must take immediate action to ensure that this is fully and fairly investigated by the authorities with full and unconditional cooperation from the company. APP must also launch a full investigation of security procedures and its contractors to ensure such incidents never happen again. We expect the company to be transparent in addressing this issue.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, March 3, 2015: The completed purchase of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd puts buyer Sime Darby Plantations on the spot: will it match NBPOL’s responsible palm oil practices on the ground, in particular by adopting a comprehensive forest conservation policy across its entire supply chain?
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;NBPO is a founding member of the Palm Oil Innovation Group, and was one of the leading companies in the Greenpeace Score card launched in 2012. Sime Darby on the other hand has not shown the leadership one would expect from the biggest plantation company in the world. The company does not have a strong Zero Deforestation policy across its global supply chains, like competitors Wilmar, Cargill, GAR, Musim Mas and Asian Agri now have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Palm Oil Innovation Group Charter builds on the current RSPO Principles &amp;amp; Criteria, and sets a strong standard on the key values of protecting High Conservation Value Forests, High Carbon Stock Forests and peatlands, respecting customary land rights and labour rights and responsible agricultural practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner Annisa Rahmawati said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We encourage Sime Darby to adopt NBPO’s strong leadership role and the commitments that NBPOL is implementing on the ground, including membership of POIG. Following this purchase, we will keep close watch to see whether those commitments are adopted by Sime Darby, not watered down.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace statement on Rainforest Alliance report ‘An Evaluation of Asia Pulp &amp; Paper’s Progress to Meet its Forest Conservation Policy (2013) and Additional Public Statements’
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace welcomes the &lt;a title="RA" href="http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/sites/default/files/uploads/4/150205-Rainforest-Alliance-APP-Evaluation-Report-en.pdf"&gt;Rainforest Alliance independent evaluation&lt;/a&gt; of APP’s progress in delivering its zero deforestation and supply chain commitments. The report identifies important areas that need to be addressed by APP but Greenpeace believes the company to still be on track to deliver its commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been closely monitoring APP’s implementation of its Forest Conservation Policy (FCP) since it was announced in February 2013. We have carefully reviewed the Rainforest Alliance report and consider that it is a fair and balanced assessment of just how far APP has come in delivering its policies to protect natural forests, peatlands and other high conservation values. This includes how it is addressing community rights issues across its suppliers’ operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zulfahmi, forest campaigner at Greenpeace Southeast Asia said: “&lt;em&gt;Whilst the Rainforest Alliance report finds that APP has met its commitment to impose a moratorium on its suppliers to stop converting areas of natural forest and peatland into plantations, the authors documented ongoing deforestation and logging inside APP supplier concessions by other parties&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zulfahmi continued:  “&lt;em&gt;The Rainforest Alliance highlights a number of important challenges that APP still needs to tackle. Greenpeace concludes that the company is still on track to deliver its commitments, however APP needs to intensify its efforts to address these challenges by making additional improvements in implementing its Forest Conservation Policy commitments.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Greenpeace expects APP to be completely transparent on how it is meeting these policy commitments&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace welcomes APP’s announcement today to make additional improvements on the implementation of its FCP.  We want to see APP take immediate concrete actions to address forest conversion and degradation by other parties within its suppliers’ concessions.  This will mean a fundamental change in the relationship with customary and local communities towards having them as partners in forest conservation. We also urge APP to prioritise addressing the hundreds of outstanding complaints in its concessions and strengthen the implementation of its policy to safeguard community rights, including its application of the principle of Free and Prior Informed Consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, APP has announced how it will develop and implement the peatland commitment in its FCP.  Greenpeace is pleased to note APP has engaged Deltares to lead a group of international peat experts to re-map the characteristics of around 4 million hectares of peatland (some 20% of Indonesia's peatland) in and around APP supplier concessions. This new data will provide the basis for recommendations to APP on protecting forested peatland, restoring degraded peatland areas, and development of a new standard for best management practices for peatland at a landscape level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolving the larger problems of achieving zero deforestation in Indonesia requires the government, companies and NGOs to work together to address issues such as overlapping licences, land conflicts with communities, illegal encroachment and other issues that undermine forest protection. Companies like APP can set and implement ambitious zero deforestation policies, but unless the government overhauls its laws and policies in favour of forest protection and strictly enforces existing laws, deforestation will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APP’s progress against its zero deforestation policy stands in marked contrast to APRIL, its only major competitor in Indonesia. Whilst APP and its suppliers ended all further rainforest and peatland clearance two years ago, APRIL confirmed at the beginning of 2014, through its Forest Policy, that its suppliers’ bulldozers would continue clearing forest and peatland up until 2020. Further, a recent &lt;a href="http://docdroid.net/q7nk"&gt;independent audit&lt;/a&gt; into its operations found that none of its 50 suppliers was in compliance with its new policy. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/sites/files/gpuk/20150113%20Update%20for%20Customers%20of%20RGE%20Group%20Final.pdf"&gt;Investigations by Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; and other Indonesian NGOs document widespread forest clearance including clearance of deep peat in violation of Ministry of Forestry regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APRIL is increasingly isolated amongst large plantation companies in Indonesia. A number of major companies have now made commitments to end deforestation across their supply chain, including APRIL’s sister palm oil company Asian Agri. Other companies including GAR, Wilmar, Cargill, and Musim Mas have also signed a pledge with KADIN (the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce) to support political reform to end deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has not advocated that companies boycott APP since late 2012. In line with Greenpeace’s long standing organisational position never to endorse individual companies or their products, we do not advocate buying from the company. Our position remains the same as in 2014: companies choosing to enter into commercial relations with APP should include specific clauses in their supply contract to ensure that APP continues to make measurable progress against meeting its Forest Conservation Policy commitment. APP is fully aware of this position and is fully supportive of this due diligence approach to contract clauses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace endorse the &lt;a href="http://environmentalpaper.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/EPN_Vision_FINAL_English_JUNE17.pdf"&gt;Environmental Paper Network’s Global Paper Vision&lt;/a&gt;. As such, we recommend all buyers of pulp and paper to choose recycled and FSC-certified products.&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 9 March 2015 – Singapore-based pulp and paper company, Asia Pacific Resources International Ltd (APRIL) and its parent group, Royal Golden Eagle (RGE) are under pressure after “Post-It Notes” maker 3M became the latest company to suspend purchases from  RGE because of the group’s ongoing destruction of Indonesian rainforests. Meanwhile, Spanish bank Santander has stopped financing APRIL because of its role in the destruction of Indonesia's rainforests, and ABN AMRO has said any further loans are predicated on APRIL implementing an immediate moratorium on further clearance as a first step towards addressing its deforestation.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Working in collaboration with ForestEthics and Greenpeace, 3M last week launched a new policy to ensure its materials are produced sustainably and with respect for human rights. As a step in implementing the policy, 3M cancelled further purchases from Sateri, a pulp company that is part of the RGE group, saying in a letter to the company that it was doing so because “the Royal Golden Eagle Group is associated with deforestation and social conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Todd Paglia, executive director of ForestEthics said: “Consumers are increasingly demanding assurance that the products they buy are produced in ways that protect our environment and respect human rights – the kind of transparency and leadership 3M offers in this revised policy represents an important step forward for the industry."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zulfahmi, forests campaigner for Greenpeace Indonesia, said: “By ending its business dealings with a controversial forest destroyer like the Royal Golden Eagle Group, of which APRIL is a part, 3M has demonstrated its intention to make good on its new policy by taking firm measures. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Last month, just seventeen days into a  Greenpeace campaign targeting its funding of APRIL, and after receiving thousands of queries and complaints from customers, multinational Bank Santander announced that “Banco Santander has decided to not renew the current funding to APRIL and will not be extending further funding at this stage. Any future loans will be conditional on APRIL implementing new sustainability measures which address its involvement with deforestation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In recent months, Greenpeace has also been speaking to ABN AMRO about its loans to APRIL. Based on these discussions, ABN AMRO has urged APRIL to take steps to address its deforestation, starting with an immediate moratorium on further forest clearance. ABN AMRO will not provide the company with any new or re-financing until APRIL has implemented new sustainability measures which prove that they comply with ABN AMRO's sustainability criteria. To ensure those criteria are sufficiently robust, ABN AMRO is engaging with stakeholders to strengthen its lending policy and ensure that its investments do not contribute to deforestation and support nature conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Zulfahmi commented on finance sector concerns about Indonesia’s forests: “The Indonesian Financial Services Authority [OJK] has issued a Roadmap to Sustainable Finance for Indonesian banks, with the goal that deforestation and the draining of peatlands be halted in order to achieve greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.  The steps taken by ABN AMRO and Santander, who do not wish to be further involved with APRIL’s deforestation, are narrowing the funding options for APRIL, both here and overseas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;APRIL is one of the largest remaining deforesters in Indonesia, clearing rainforest and draining peatlands to turn into pulpwood plantations. A recent independent audit confirmed that it has failed to live up to key commitments made in its sustainability policy issued in early 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 5 November 2015 - New photos and video released today by Greenpeace Southeast Asia show freshly planted palm oil saplings on deforested peatland where several fires have recently broken out at the edges of an orangutan sanctuary. [1] Greenpeace has called on the Indonesian government to ensure that no one profits from the forest destruction caused by the haze crisis by requiring all forest and peatlands that have been burnt in the fires to be restored.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;he best available maps, now several years old, do not indicate any oil palm concession has been granted in the area investigated by Greenpeace Southeast Asia. The government refuses to release newer maps for analysis, while the anti corruption commission last month reported that unreported forest clearing cost up to US$9 billion over the past decade in lost timber royalties. Last week, a suspicious fire destroyed paper-based records at the Central Kalimantan government’s finance department. [2] Police have launched a criminal investigation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These fires are one of the worst disasters ever to hit this country. It is unthinkable that anyone should be allowed to profit from such a crisis. President Jokowi has called for restoration after the fires – and that must mean restoring forests and peatlands, not planting with oil palm,” said Annisa Rahmawati, Indonesia Forests campaigner at Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As fires raged on the edges of the Nyaru Menteng orangutan sanctuary in Central Kalimantan late last month, National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) Chief of Data and Information, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho posted a photo to his Twitter account which quickly went viral. [3] Paired with the caption “After the fire, comes the oil palm”, the photo showed a landscape of burned tree stumps with oil palm seedlings freshly planted in rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Indonesian Palm Oil Producers Association (GAPKI) responded by claiming the industry was the victim of a smear campaign, suggesting that the planting was orchestrated to damage the image of Indonesia’s palm oil industry. [4] However, when Greenpeace visited the area on 27 October local people told investigators that the area had been burnt twice, around a month earlier, apparently as a prelude to planting with oil palm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The police are still investigating this area to find out if a crime took place. Yet someone is already trying to exploit this fire by establishing an oil palm plantation. Who owns this land? Were these fires started on purpose? We won’t know until the government makes good on its promise to publish concession maps and hold those responsible for these fires to account,” Annisa said.&lt;/p&gt;

	JAKARTA: Environmental NGOs including Greenpeace met with President Joko Widodo at the palace on Friday to discuss solutions to the peatlands and forest fires crisis.  Following that meeting, President Jokowi held a cabinet meeting and issued a statement that there would be “no new concessions on peatlands”. Greenpeace Indonesia’s Longgena Ginting, who attended the palace meeting said on Monday:

	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Indonesia is in state of emergency with fires burning from Papua to Sumatra. The President’s decision to fight the fires by protecting forests and peatlands and enforcing the law is a good first step.  Now palm oil and pulp companies, whose decades of forest and peatland destruction have caused today’s fires, must respond in kind. Companies must work around the clock to put out fires, build fire breaks and block drainage canals. Everything else must be put on hold until the crisis is under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The Indonesian people have a right to know what is happening on the ground. Companies must be transparent and support the President’s One Map proposal by publishing all concession maps by the end of October.  Instead of attacking IPOP and other sustainable industry initiatives, the government should release the maps it has and name and shame companies that refuse to publish their own maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The people of Indonesia and the Southeast Asia region should not have to endure another haze crisis. There must be an immediate, industry-wide moratorium on forest and peatland development. From now on, there must be a unanimous agreement that any company putting lives at risk by clearing forests will be unable to sell its produce. Companies that ignore the warnings and continue to destroy forests and peatlands must be held responsible for fires and haze engulfing Southeast Asia.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 29 October 2015 -  Greenpeace has launched a challenge to the plantation industry to respond to the devastating scale of the forest fires crisis, set out in a new Greenpeace Southeast Asia analysis. [1] The four-step Fire Action Plan aims to bring the fires under control and make sure there is no repeat of this disaster. [2] Greenpeace has also released a new set of photos that show how people are affected by smoke from the fires. [3] 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s analysis shows that deforestation and peatland drainage by pulp and palm oil companies is the root cause of the haze crisis. Encouragingly, last week, President Widodo promised to address the ongoing fires crisis by protecting  peatlands, and by improving governance and law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There can be no question that the root cause of the fires crisis is decades of forest and peatland destruction by pulp and palm oil companies.These fires and the toxic haze will return year after year until plantation companies turn off their bulldozers. Businesses, must demonstrate serious efforts to work together to prevent forest fires by stamping out this reckless destruction and start protecting rainforests and peatlands,” said Teguh Surya, Indonesia Forest Campaigner at Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The data that we’ve released indicate that the company associated with the most fire hotspots is Asia Pulp &amp;amp; Paper. This is not surprising. Firstly, they are the largest concession holder in Indonesia and have a legacy of deforestation, particularly in the south of Sumatra where a lot of these fires are concentrated. Secondly, they are the only company that has released accurate maps showing where their own, as well as their suppliers concessions are. We cannot tell you how bad the situation is for other companies because none of them have volunteered the same level of information. It makes you wonder, what do they have to hide?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparency is widely regarded as critical to fighting not only forest fires, but corruption and other bad practices associated with Indonesia’s plantation sector. Just last Friday, President Joko Widodo reiterated his intention to publish a comprehensive mapping database, known as the One Map. [4] However, the government has recently refused Greenpeace’s request to make public the latest concession map data for analysis. Companies have released very little information about their land holdings and the concessions that supply them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indonesian government has repeatedly refused to name the companies that it is investigating for their role in the haze crisis. Greenpeace Southeast Asia has therefore published a full list of all concessions in Indonesia where fires have been recorded during the crisis, and the number of fires in each. Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s analysis is based on the best available data, which does not mean that it is complete or fully up-to-date. It is calling on companies to support the President’s One Map initiative by publishing their concession maps and the maps of their suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The people of Indonesia and the Southeast Asia region should not have to endure another haze crisis. The pulp and palm oil industries must work together to deliver an immediate, industry-wide ban on forest and peatland development. They must publish their maps and start protecting forests and peatlands. Companies that ignore the warnings and continue to destroy forests and peatlands must be held responsible for fires and haze engulfing Southeast Asia,” said Teguh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] Fire hotspot analysis summary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/fhsdata"&gt;http://bit.ly/fhsdata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Southeast Asia researchers looked at 112,000 fire hotspots recorded from August 1 to October 26, 2015. This showed nearly 40 percent of fires in this period had occurred inside mapped concessions: land granted by the Indonesian government to companies for logging or plantation development. Twenty percent of fires were in pulp concessions and sixteen percent in palm oil concessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just under half of all fires were recorded in just two provinces: Central Kalimantan (25%) and South Sumatra (22%). Kalimantan and Sumatra formed the basis of Indonesia’s plantation development for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost half of all fires were on peat soils, which makes up only 10% of Indonesia’s land mass. This reinforces the importance of protecting Indonesia’s peatlands from further development and drainage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worryingly, almost 10% of all fire hotspots were recorded in Papua, where companies have just started developing industrial plantations. Fires on this scale have never before been recorded in Papua. It risks becoming a trend if government and industry continue with their plans for plantation expansion in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] Greenpeace’s Fire Action Plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Require all suppliers to immediately stop forest clearance and any further development on peatland. Actively monitor suppliers to ensure compliance with this policy. Suspend trade with any supplier that continues clearing forest or draining peatlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Re-flood and implement other water management measures in critical peatland areas to mitigate fire risks, based on advice from independent peat experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Support the Indonesian government’s One Map initiative by publishing all maps for your own and suppliers’ concessions through Global Forest Watch’s online forest monitoring and alert system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Support an industry-wide ban on forest clearance and peatland development in Indonesia and work with other stakeholders to deliver it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

	Hanoi - Existing coal plants in Vietnam cause an estimated 4,300 premature deaths every year, which can be avoided by switching to renewable energy, according Harvard University research presented at ‘Coal and Coal Power: The Unknowns’ conference in Hanoi. If new projects under development are realised,  this could rise to 25,000 premature deaths per year.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"According to the research carried out at Harvard University, the number of deaths related to coal-fired power in Vietnam was 4,300 people. In the context of Vietnam’s economic growth and direction recently, deaths from coal power threaten to escalate, along with associated medical expenses due to the decline of people’s health,” said Mr. Tran Dinh Sinh, representing the Vietnam Sustainable Energy Alliance (VSEA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those findings are part of a Harvard University research series to look at the level of morbidity and mortality associated with coal-fired power plants in Southeast Asia. It follows a recent report Harvard and Greenpeace Southeast Asia released “Human Cost of Coal-Indonesia”, which estimated 28,300 premature deaths, emphasising the need of an immediate shift to renewable energy in Indonesia. The Harvard series will continue over the next few months, including research on Thailand and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vietnam Sustainable Energy Alliance (VSEA) also published research results on the impacts of a major coal ash spill from the Quang Ninh Thermal Power Plant (TPP) in late July that claimed over 17 victims and left 30 injured, destroyed over 300 homes and released toxic pollution into the environment. VSEA found that the areas affected by the flood were contaminated with significantly elevated levels of arsenic, manganese and chromium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the data published by VSEA, the planned development of thermal power plant will generate huge amounts of coal ash, estimated at 14.8 million tonnes per year from 2020 and up to 29.1 million tonnes per year from 2030, with a potential for significant impacts on the environment and community health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Renewable energy is the future of Southeast Asia, not coal,” said Arif Fiyanto, Greenpeace Southeast Asia Coal Campaigner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Southeast Asia is one of the most vulnerable, but least prepared region to deal with the climate change impacts. To avoid these catastrophic impact s, our coal addiction needs be stopped immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now is the time for ASEAN to commit to a truly secure and sustainable energy future – one built on genuinely clean technologies, economic development and the creation of hundreds of thousands of green jobs – it’s time for a Coal Free Southeast Asia,” Arif concluded. &lt;/p&gt;

	Critical orangutan habitat under threat as forest fires encircle Gunung Palung National Park in Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jakarta, 7 October 2015 - Shocking UAV footage captured by Greenpeace Southeast Asia field researchers shows the massive underground peat fires burning across Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The footage was shot around the edge of the Gunung Palung National Park, a major reservoir of biodiversity in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. It shows fires burning in the deep peat surrounding the National Park and in nearby palm oil concessions - the result of decades of illegal logging and deforestation for oil palm and pulp plantations. Gunung Palung National Park contains one of the world’s largest surviving populations of wild orangutans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July and August 2015, fires were widespread across Tesso Nilo National Park in Riau, Sumatra, an area of vital tiger habitat that has been devastated by illegal encroachment including palm oil development. Fires have also been reported around Tanjung Puting National Park in Central Kalimantan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As governments prepare to meet in Paris to save the world from catastrophic warming, the earth in Indonesia is already on fire. Companies destroying forests and draining peatland have made Indonesia’s landscape into a huge carbon bomb, and the drought has given it a thousand fuses. The Indonesian government can no longer turn a blind eye to this destruction when half of Asia is living with the consequences,”  said Bustar Maitar, Indonesian Forest Project Leader for Greenpeace Southeast Asia,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesian forest fires pose a huge threat to people’s health across Southeast Asia, and are estimated to result in 110,000 deaths each year from respiratory and other illnesses [1]. They are also a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions that threaten the world’s climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indonesian government’s own data show that deforestation and peatland destruction are responsible for nearly two-thirds of Indonesia’s GHG emissions [2]. Severe peatland and forest fires in Indonesia in the El Niño year of 1997 produced carbon emissions estimated to be equivalent to up to 40% of global fossil fuel emissions [3]. 2015 is forecast to be the biggest El Niño year since 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These fires are a harsh reminder of the pulp and palm oil industry’s legacy of destruction. Companies need to rise to the challenge and work together to break the link between commodity production and forest destruction. Unilateral no-deforestation policies are not working. Companies must eliminate the economic incentive to trash forests with an industry-wide ban on trade with anyone that clears forest,” Bustar Maitar said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deforestation rates have increased dramatically between 2010 and 2013 despite the introduction of a 2011 moratorium on new permits to clear primary forest or peatland [4]. In recent years, many companies that produce, trade or use palm oil and other commodities from Indonesia have pledged to take action on forest destruction. Yet deforestation indicators provided by the World Resources Institute strongly suggest the upward trend is continuing.&lt;/p&gt;

	Forest fires are continuing to fuel hazardous air pollution across swathes of Sumatra and Kalimantan in Indonesia, with haze reaching as far as Singapore and Malaysia. Greenpeace Southeast Asia today released a briefing explaining the background causes and solutions to this crisis.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace Indonesia forests campaigner, Annisa Rahmawati, said: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Decades of forest destruction and peatland drainage have turned Indonesia’s landscape into a carbon bomb. Now a thousand fuses are burning.  Whether or not they actually light the match, companies have created the conditions in which forest and peatland fires take hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems like Jokowi’s promises are about as hazy as the air around us. Indonesia’s pledge for the Paris climate summit makes no commitment to address the causes of forest and peatland fires, despite being a globally significant source of greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Last year, the President promised to tackle the crisis. Jokowi pledged to review company concessions and take immediate action to protect forests and peatlands. We’re still waiting for his government to deliver. If the President wants to stop these fires, his government must publish the concession maps we need to hold companies to account and stop blocking private sector initiatives to protect and restore forest and peatland areas.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 10 September 2015 - A thick smoke haze from the thousands of fires blanketing Sumatra and Kalimantan is testament to the government’s ongoing failure to address forest clearing and peatland destruction. Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s analysis shows 3,464 fire hotspots this year in Indonesia’s peatlands, which make up a fraction of the nation’s landmass, compared with 5,076 fires elsewhere. This is not a new phenomenon – last year 75 percent of fire alerts in Sumatra overlapped with peatlands.[1]

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last November Indonesian president Joko Widodo visited Sungai Tohor in Riau, one of the provinces most affected by peatland fires, and personally blocked one of the many canals dug to drain peatlands for plantations. He identified conversion of forests and peatlands as the main cause of the annual smoke haze, and promised a thousand canals would be dammed in Riau with the government’s help. This year, while the area immediately upstream of the President’s dam in Sungai Tohor has so far been safe from fire, the rest of the province’s peatlands have not been so lucky, with only a handful of the thousand dams realised. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The location of fires shows that they are clearly related to forest clearing and peatland drainage. Greenpeace urges the government to undertake rapid intervention to protect peatlands and remaining forest areas, including best-practice mapping of the nation's peatlands,” said Teguh Surya, a forest campaigner at Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week Indonesia revealed its draft Intended Nationally-Determined Contribution (INDC) submission for the COP21 climate summit. This document should have set out solutions to the ongoing deforestation crisis, which has pushed Indonesia into the ranks of the world’s top GHG emitters. Unfortunately, despite Indonesia’s commitments under the New York Declaration on Forests and the soon-to-be-ratified Sustainable Development Goals, the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/Global/international/briefings/forests/2015/Indonesia%20INDC%20Briefer.pdf"&gt;draft INDC fails to provide any commitment to zero deforestation&lt;/a&gt;, or peatland protection and restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Joko Widodo will soon lead a large delegation to the Paris climate talks. Imagine the embarrassment for Indonesia on the world stage if our commitments do not deal with deforestation and peatland destruction, which is responsible for nearly two-thirds of Indonesia’s GHG emissions,” Teguh Surya said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current INDC was drafted with cursory public consultation, and insufficient transparency of data sources. It contains no analysis of Indonesia’s emissions over the last ten years, no baseline predictions and no assessment of what carbon emission reductions are required of various sectors to meet the proposed new target.[2] Worse still, while the previous target of 26% emissions reductions compared to business as usual by 2020 would genuinely reduce emissions, the new INDC target of only 3 percent additional emissions reduction by 2030 abandons this improvement to return to a rapidly rising emissions trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government’s aversion to transparency extends beyond the figures in the INDC to a refusal to release land management information including detailed maps showing who controls forests and peatlands. Without land tenure maps in the public domain it is very difficult to identify who is responsible for forest and peatland clearance, and who is fuelling the current haze problem. It undermines the commitments of buyers and traders to end the trade of palm oil linked to deforestation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indonesians have a right to know who is behind forest and peatland destruction, and to have input into our INDC to ensure the government does something real to stop it,” said. “We won’t let the government hide behind a smokescreen of its own making,” Teguh Surya said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;[2] The INDC says its methodology ‘will refer to the National Inventory System of Greenhouse Gases (SIGN SMART), UNFCCC Biannual Update Report (BUR), and FREL-REDD+ document’. However, the first two sources are not yet fully published, or at least not available to the public, and the FREL REDD+ document (see elsewhere) contains major omissions, in that it does not estimate peat fire emissions and only includes peat decomposition emissions resulting from deforestation after 2000, thereby excluding considerable ongoing emissions from degradation of peat deforested before 2000. What is available of the SIGN reports also appears not to include peat fires, which worryingly suggests this area is not a priority for current MoEF thinking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	In 2011, after pressure from Greenpeace, customers and other NGOs, GAR announced a Forest Conservation Policy that aims to protect forests and peatlands in its estates. While GAR at the time was the first company to publish such a commitment, at the moment it is seriously falling short in implementation, which is emphasized by the fact that its implementation partner Tropical Forest Trust has now suspended the membership of one of GAR’s subsidiaries, the plantation company PT SMART. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In December 2014 Greenpeace released  '&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Forests-Reports/GAR-Progress-Report/"&gt;Golden Agri Resources - A progress report&lt;/a&gt;' that showed while GAR has made important progress on the development of the HCS Approach, the company still has much work to do to ensure that its palm oil is truly from a responsible source. In that report -- which GAR responded to publicly by saying it took the “constructive” recommendations seriously -- we urged GAR to take immediate action to improve performance. We especially called on the company to implement the Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) process and conflict resolution in its dealings with local communities. Also we urged the company to publish a supply chain policy to ensure that all the palm oil it trades is from responsible sources. At the moment the company is falling behind companies like Wilmar and Cargill, that are taking serious steps to clean up their trade in palm oil.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Since the launch of the report, however, the company has failed to provide us with a clear action plan on how to resolve most of those issues. Also, from our NGO colleagues and partners we understand that GAR is failing to address critical issues. A serious complaint was submitted by Forest Peoples Program to the RSPO, which subsequently found the company to be in breach of RSPO Principles and Criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We are very disappointed with how the company is currently dealing with the commitments they made when they launched their FCP. In particular we would like to see immediate actions and a clear plan on how the company will ensure the protection of the HCS forests, HCV areas and peatland within the areas they propose to develop, and how they will ensure that their third party suppliers are doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;

	April 15, 2015 – Activists are calling on the World Bank to heed its own advice and follow a clear pathway to low-carbon development – starting with its own energy sector operations.  While the Bank has ruled out direct support for coal plants in all but the poorest countries of the world, indirectly it continues to provide support for at least three massive coal plants in Indonesia.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“The World Bank continues to support the Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund which is providing crucial guarantees to the controversial 2000 MW Batang coal plant in Central Java and two coal plants in South Sumatra. This is unacceptable. If the World Bank is serious about low carbon development, it must immediately ensure that none of its funds are being used to either directly or indirectly support the development of high carbon infrastructure such as coal plants.” said Arif Fiyanto, Climate and Energy Campaign Team Leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week in Washington, DC the Spring Meetings of the World Bank will bring together thousands of government officials, civil society organizations, journalists and private sector representatives to debate the institutions’ work and implications for international development.  With the United Nations’ climate negotiations set to conclude a global agreement in Paris this December, it is a critical time for the Bank to put forward ambitious and concrete commitments on how the World Bank will lead the world onto a low-carbon development path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through &lt;a href="http://priceofoil.org/2013/09/25/world-bank-accelerating-coal-development-indonesia/"&gt;four World Bank infrastructure policy lending operations&lt;/a&gt; worth $850 million, Indonesia established the Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund(IIGF) and the 2012 Land Acquisition Law to support a development model based on public-private partnerships (PPP).  The IIGF provided its first government guarantee of $34 million to the Central Java coal power megaplant of Batang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the World Bank has a direct $30 million loan to the IIGF which, according to the Bank, involves “a platform for ongoing engagement in the development and appraisal of PPP infrastructure operations” seeking IIGF guarantees.  As part of this commitment, IIGF projects are supposed to adhere to the World Bank’s own Social and Environmental Safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For nearly four years, thousands of Batang residents have struggled against the development of the Batang coal power megaplant to protect their rich agricultural land fishing grounds, and their livelihoods,” said Arif Fiyanto. “They have been constantly threatened and attacked by thugs, police, army, and government agents. The project is clearly in violation of the Bank’s safeguard policies yet the Bank has refused to step in and prevent IIGF support for the project,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Villagers’ continued refusal to sell their land for the proposed coal plant has forced the Indonesian government to extend the deadline for financial closure of the project for three consecutive years. In violation of Presidential Regulation No. 66 of 2013, the government has refused to cancel the project and instead is threatening to exercise a clause in the World Bank-supported 2012 Land Acquisition Law to compulsorily acquire remaining lands. Nor did troubles with Batang cause the World Bank to stop IIGF from approving further government guarantees for two new coal power plants in February 2015 in South Sumatra – Sumsel 9 and 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is vital to underscore that the IIGF has not provided any government guarantees to clean renewable energy infrastructure projects,” said Heike Mainhardt, an expert on World Bank support for coal. “This is all the more shocking considering Indonesia’s vast and largely untapped potential for geothermal, solar, and other renewable energies. President Kim specifically called on countries to end harmful subsidies to fossil fuels, yet the World Bank is still creating new subsidies to fossil fuels through government guarantees and tax breaks for infrastructure investments. This must end.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace commends APRIL and calls on government to support environment, communities and progressive companies with forest sector reform&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Deforestation for pulp and paper, and palm oil, is a leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia. If properly implemented, APRIL’s pledge will prove to be another major step by business towards protecting Indonesia’s rainforests and peatlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; APRIL’s parent company, the Royal Golden Eagle group, has also announced that new sustainability policies will be implemented by all other pulp companies in the group, including an end to deforestation. Greenpeace is suspending its campaign to give APRIL and other RGE group companies time to put these new policies into practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “We commend APRIL for agreeing to end its deforestation, although we will be watching closely to make sure that today’s announcement leads to real change on the ground,” said Bustar Maitar, Head of Greenpeace’s Forest Campaign in Indonesia. “Today’s commitment from APRIL and the RGE Group is yet more proof that forest protection is the way forward for plantation companies in Indonesia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; APRIL has agreed to a number of new conservation measures, including using the High Carbon Stock Approach to identify and protect forest areas remaining in their concessions. The company has also agreed to protect forested peatlands and has established a Peat Expert Working Group to help it develop international best practice for managing peatlands to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Indonesia’s peatlands store an estimated 60 billion metric tons of carbon. When peatlands are drained for plantations this carbon is released, and the landscape becomes susceptible to smouldering fires which blanket the region in an annual haze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; APRIL has also agreed to work collaboratively and transparently to resolve its outstanding social conflicts and to support development opportunities for local communities that do not involve deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; APRIL’s announcement follows similar decisions by other major players in the pulp and palm oil sectors to protect Indonesia’s forests and peatlands. In September, some of the biggest palm oil producers in Indonesia, including APRIL’s sister companies Asian Agri and Apical, agreed to end deforestation. Equally, there is growing support from the business community in Indonesia for a development model based on forest protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “President Jokowi promised to stop plantation companies damaging the environment or harming communities. Yet even though Indonesia’s biggest pulpwood and palm oil companies are moving away from deforestation, the destruction on the ground continues. The government must now act to reform the forest sector so it works for people and the environment,” said Maitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ENDS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Notes to Editors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Largely as a result of the rapid expansion of the palm oil and pulp and paper sector into Indonesia’s rainforests and peatlands, by 2005 Indonesia ranked as the world’s third-highest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Loss of its forest habitat to pulp and palm oil concessions has driven endangered wildlife species such as Sumatran tiger and the orangutan closer to extinction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asia Pacific Resources International Ltd. (APRIL) is the second largest pulp and paper company in Indonesia, and one of the largest pulp and paper producers in the world. Its new Sustainable Forest Management Plan (SFMP) is available on its website, &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aprilasia.com/en/sustainability/sustainability-policy"&gt;http://www.aprilasia.com/en/sustainability/sustainability-policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-AU"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alongside APRIL’s new policy, the Royal Golden Eagle Group has published sustainability principles that are to be implemented by its pulp companies, including Toba Pulp Lestari, Asia Symbol and Sateri. Those principles are available on its website,  &lt;a href="http://www.rgei.com/"&gt;http://www.rgei.com&lt;/a&gt;.  The palm oil companies in the RGE Group, Asian Agri and Apical, announced new sustainability policies, including an end to deforestation, in September 2014. &lt;a href="http://www.apicalgroup.com/sustainability"&gt;http://www.apicalgroup.com/sustainability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;APRIL and Asia Pulp &amp;amp; Paper (APP) together account for approximately 80% of Indonesian pulp production. APP announced a new Forest Conservation Policy that included an end to deforestation in 2013. These companies were the only large-scale producers of pulp using rainforest fibre. The other pulp companies either use plantation acacia only, or produce very small volumes of pulp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary of APRIL’s Sustainable Forest Management Plan commitments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An end to further development of any forested land, including peat forests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with international experts to develop best practice peatland management at landscape level to reduce and avoid greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protocols to ensure that communities can exercise their right to free prior and informed consent, and to resolve conflicts with communities affected by current operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conserving an area of land equal in size to APRIL’s plantations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional measures to support responsible forest management throughout APRIL’s global supply chain.&lt;/li&gt;

	Jakarta, Indonesia - Existing coal plants in Indonesia cause an estimated 7,100 premature deaths every year according to research by Harvard University and Greenpeace Southeast Asia – the first of its kind to look at illness and deaths associated with Indonesia’s coal-fired power plants. This number could climb to over 28,000 per year if the Indonesian government goes ahead with an ambitious rollout of more than one hundred new coal-fired power plants.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;These worrying figures are based on new atmospheric modeling conducted by a research team at Harvard University’s Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group, using a cutting edge atmospheric chemistry-transport model, GEOS-Chem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Jokowi has a choice: stay with a business-as-usual approach to generating electricity and see the lives of thousands of Indonesians cut short, or lead the switch and rapid expansion to safe, clean, renewable energy,” said Hindun Mulaika, Climate and Energy Campaigner at Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every new coal-fired power plant means elevated health risks for Indonesian people.  Lives are cut short through strokes, heart attacks, lung cancer and other cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The health impacts sadly also include deaths of many young children,” said Hindun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The proposed “clean coal” power plant at Batang alone could cause 30,000 premature deaths over an operating life of 40 years. But the good news is that the President’s choice just became a lot clearer Indonesia has the opportunity to leapfrog dirty technologies and follow other world leaders making the switch to clean energy. This would result in a healthier, safer and more prosperous population,” said Hindun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report, &lt;em&gt;The Human Cost of Coal,&lt;/em&gt; is being launched following the recent announcement by President Jokowi to build an additional 35 GW of new power plants, 22 GW of which would come from coal power plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Emissions from coal-fired power plants form particulate matter and ozone that are detrimental to human health. Indonesia is one of the countries in the world with the largest plans to expand coal-fired power generation, yet little has been done to explore the associated health impacts. Our results show that planned coal expansion could significantly increase pollution levels across Indonesia. The human health cost from this rising coal pollution should be considered when making choices about Indonesia's energy future,” said Shannon Koplitz, lead Harvard researcher in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New power generation in China, US, and the EU is already coming predominantly from renewables and 2014 was the first year that renewable energy growth overtook fossil fuel growth globally. China, which offers a warning example of where unfettered coal expansion could be taking Indonesia, is steering away from coal because of the horrendous toll on air quality and health,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, Greenpeace East Asia coal and air pollution specialist.&lt;/p&gt;

	Kuala Lumpur, 29 August 2014 – Greenpeace today joined local groups calling on the Malaysian government to deny the granting of a permanent license for the Lynas plant in Kuantan, citing the grave and unresolved radioactive and environmental threats associated with the controversial rare earth processing facility. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“We appeal to the Malaysian authorities to listen to the demands of local groups and deny the &lt;br&gt;granting of a permanent operating license to Lynas. Our research on the issue reveals that Lynas &lt;br&gt;has not been operating according to best environmental practices and standards. As far as we &lt;br&gt;know, the company has yet to come up with a convincingly safe and acceptable solution for its &lt;br&gt;radioactive waste outputs, and this is cause for grave public concern,” said Von Hernandez, &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace Southeast Asia Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environmental group made the appeal a few days before the government was to decide &lt;br&gt;whether or not to issue a permanent operating license to the Lynas plant, which has faced &lt;br&gt;intense opposition from local groups since the facility started operating a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group’s demands were based on findings contained in its new report entitled ‘A Radioactive &lt;br&gt;Ruse’, which highlights a number of concerns linked to the Australian multinational’s rare earth &lt;br&gt;processing facility, including the company’s insufficient and dubious plans on how it intends to &lt;br&gt;contain and deal with the estimated 6 million tons of waste, with at least 1 million tons likely to &lt;br&gt;be and radioactive waste, that the plant is projected to generate over a production period of 20 &lt;br&gt;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace joined a panel of speakers in the launch of ‘A Radiocative Ruse: report-lynas.org’ &lt;br&gt;who each urged the denial of the permanent operating licence to Lynas Corporation for the LAMP  at Kuantan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Ali Akbar, Chairperson, Stop Lynas Coalition reflected that ‘ the Malay community continue to be kept in the dark about the impacts of the Lynas Kuantan plant, we are concerned about the way the impact on our health and environment with radioactive waste so near our homes’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A local fisherman from Balok Village, Mr Mahmud Yaakub further highlighted that in his community, ‘We are concerned, we notice that there are less fish and cannot get information that tells us how all this waste is made safe.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Wong Tack, Chairman of Himpunan Hijau (HH) who pledged, ‘Five days from now, at midnight on the 2nd of September, we expect that the doors of the Lynas plant will shut, when this happens, we know that the Malaysian Government have listened to over 1.2 million concerned citizens, and our international friends. We will continue our work to protect our beautiful country, Malaysia.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Tan Bun Teet, Spokesperson for Save Malaysia Stop Lynas (SMSL) shared that ‘if the Malaysian Government has any sense of wisdom and justice left, then it should deny Lynas the permanent operating license. If the licence is issued, then we will take whatever measure is necessary to get it revoked.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of the waste generated each year from the Lynas plant could contribute significantly to background radiological exposures of workers and people around the vicinity of the plant and at its permanent disposal site, the location of which the company has so far refused to publicly disclose. Lynas’ possible planned use of a final disposal site for its radioactive waste in Malaysia directly contradicts earlier government demands that no radioactive waste should remain in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Greenpeace findings, neither Lynas nor concerned government authorities provided sufficient information to the public and local communities about the potential pollution and risks involved in the plant’s operations. The documentation provided by Lynas in order to obtain operating licenses from regulators for example, has not been made accessible to the public. Furthermore, the group accuses the company of applying lower environmental standards for its Kuantan plant, than would be allowable in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If Lynas were a truly responsible multinational company, it should adopt and observe in Malaysia, the same strict set of environmental standards and safeguards that it would be expected to comply with in its country of origin. The Malaysian government and public were also made to believe that no radioactive waste from the plant would be disposed of in Malaysia. This has now been exposed as a ruse, following reports that Lynas is now planning to “recycle” certain fractions of its radioactive waste stream into construction materials and other commercial product applications. This is a very dangerous proposition with the potential of spreading radioactive exposure rather than containing it, ” added Hernandez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We hope that the Malaysian government will exercise greater caution and not allow itself to be deceived into believing that Lynas can find safe and beneficial recycling options for its radioactive waste,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes to Editors: &lt;br&gt;Key recommendations from the report include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. [CLOSE THE LYNAS PLANT IN KUANTAN] The Lynas Corporation must close the Lynas Advanced Materials Plant (LAMP) processing plant in Kuantan, Malaysia, until it puts in &lt;br&gt;place best practice environmental protection protocols and conditions and comes up with &lt;br&gt;an acceptable solution for the plant's radioactive waste disposal outside of Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. [ADVANCE GREEN DEVELOPMENT FOR SOUTHEAST ASIA AND PROTECT &lt;br&gt;ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH] In view of the above, the (federal) government of Malaysia &lt;br&gt;must deny Lynas Corporation a permanent operating license, and prioritize the protection &lt;br&gt;of Malaysian environmental and public health interests, modelling green development &lt;br&gt;standards for Southeast Asia in the process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. [AVOID DOUBLE STANDARDS – STOP EXPORTING POLLUTION TO OTHER COUNTRIES] Government of Australia and Japan and other stakeholders in the operations of the Lynas plant in Malaysia, must uphold the same environmental protection standards, as they &lt;br&gt;demand for their own environment and populations.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace notes the announcement by Sime Darby, IOI, KLK, Musim Mas and Asian Agri that they intend to temporarily halt clearance of potential High Carbon Stock forests while a HCS study commissioned by their Sustainable Palm Oil Manifesto* group is taking place.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace welcomes the fact that a number of the world’s biggest palm oil producers have  announced a temporary halt of all clearance of potential HCS areas in their concessions after being called to action for a long time.  However, this is just a first step, Greenpeace encourages the companies to expand their No Deforestation commitment across their supply chains and trade, to ensure that they are no longer involved in deforestation, peat land clearance and social conflicts,” said Bustar Maitar in Jakarta on 19th September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since these five companies do not specify how they will identify potential HCS, Greenpeace calls on the companies to follow the HCS approach that is being used by GAR, Wilmar, Cargill and others, and to share maps and expansion plans to enable monitoring of this commitment.  Greenpeace also urges these companies to support the HCS Steering Group, established by a range of prominent companies and environment groups last month in Singapore. The HCS Steering Group will lead a process for global standardisation of the HCS methodology across commodities. This includes seeking review and advice from a science committee and expert guidance based on a range of field trials. The need for such a process could not be more pressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With recent satellite data confirming Indonesia has the world’s highest deforestation rate, driving our GHG-emmissions ever upwards despite our commitment to reductions, this is not the time to debate what a forest is,” said Bustar Maitar. “It is time to show bold action and protect forests and peatlands within concessions and through supply chains, like GAR, Wilmar and Cargill have committed to do. We encourage Sime Darby, IOI, KLK, Musim Mas and Asian Agri to do the same and turn this temporary halt into full-time protection across their supply chains and trade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace notes that RGE, the parent company of Palm Oil Manifesto signatory Asian Agri, continues with rainforest destruction in Indonesia for parts of both its palm oil and pulp and paper businesses.  RGE also owns APRIL, Indonesia’s second largest pulp and paper business, which has stated it will not stop relying on rainforest clearance until 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta: Indonesian president Joko Widodo today extended a moratorium on new concessions over forest areas, but failed to heed bipartisan calls from civil society and progressive industry to strengthen the measure in order to fully protect forests and peatlands. The renewal comes after Greenpeace conveyed the voices of over 12,000 concerned Indonesians calling for a strengthened moratorium ahead of the 13 May 2015 expiry of the existing presidential instruction. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The ‘copy-paste’ moratorium signed today is understood to leave at least 48.5 million hectares of forest – over three times the area of Java – under threat, including 16.5 million hectares of primary forest and peatlands. The remaining 32 million hectares is under threat because it is natural forest classified as ‘secondary forest’, which the current moratorium excludes; while such forest may have been disturbed by selective logging for example, it is an important carbon store and critical wildlife habitat. Much of the country’s remaining forested orang-utan habitat for instance is classified as ‘secondary forest’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s forest policy is of international importance not least because clearing and draining of peatlands and forests makes the country one of the world’s top contributors of greenhouse gas emissions. President Widodo’s predecessor committed to a 41 percent reduction in business-as-usual emissions by 2020 with international support, which has been pledged by countries such as Norway through a $1 billion deal. International eyes are on the country’s new president to see what concrete steps he will take ahead of the Paris climate talks later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Joko Widodo has failed to listen to the public demands to protect our remaining forests and peatlands. While environment minister Siti Nurbaya today issued a statement leaving the door open to strengthening the forest moratorium in future, the problem is that she has not presented any timeline. While the government prevaricates, our biodiversity dwindles and our international emissions reductions obligations go unmet. Strengthening forests protection is urgent,” said Greenpeace Indonesia forests campaigner Teguh Surya.&lt;/p&gt;

	Three months has elapsed since Mr Indra Pelani of Lubuk Mandarsyah village in Tebo district, Jambi was found dead following an incident involving a security firm contracted by Wira Karya Sakti (WKS), a company owned by Asia Pulp &amp; Paper (APP). During  this period, Greenpeace has stepped back from other engagement with APP’s Forest Conservation Policy to focus on addressing the serious issues highlighted by Indra’s case.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;On Saturday 23 May 2015 Greenpeace along with other local NGOs attended, as observers, a restorative justice ceremony in which APP/WKS presented Indra’s family with items required by tradition as a penalty for Indra’s killing. This ceremony was in no way intended as a substitute for the ongoing law enforcement process, but its successful conduct was possible because of the willingness of both the community of Lubuk Mandarsyah and APP to move on to find a solution for the underlying land dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace believes that APP is dealing with Indra’s case seriously, and continues to monitor the company’s progress on improving its social engagement and security arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

	Ketapang / Jakarta, March 29, 2017 - Peatland violations committed by the logging company PT Mohairson Pawan Khatulistiwa (MPK) in Sungai Putri forest, have resulted in an investigation carried by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. After submitting a report of the destruction of peat forests in this landscape, International Animal Rescue Indonesia, Greenpeace Indonesia and Wetlands International Indonesia, are seeking concrete steps to restore this land and protect it for the long term. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Sungai Putri is a peatland forest that covers an area of 55 thousand hectares in Ketapang, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Based on a 2008 report by Fauna and Flora International, the average depth of carbon-rich peat is over 6 meters and it is home to between 900-1250 orangutans. IUCN has placed the Borneo Orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) in the category of “critically endangered”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “We welcome the decision by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry to investigate potential illegal activity in the peat forests of Sungai Putri, but this must be followed up by urgent and concrete action that involves consultation with stakeholders in order to protect this area for the long term”, said Ratri Kusumohartono, Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In early March this year, a report was presented to the Director General of Law Enforcement at the Ministry of Environment and Forestry [1]. The document includes evidence of violation of Govt Regulation 57/2016 (Amending Govt Regulation No. 71/2014 on the Protection and Management of Peatland Ecosystems) by PT MPK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “Sungai Putri forest is the habitat of a large population of orangutans. Canal excavation activities have already impacted their home and lead to conflict among the village of Sungai Awan Kiri, Muara Pawan, Ketapang”, said Tantyo Bangun, chairman of International Animal Rescue Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In addition to photographs taken in January 2017, which show the development of a 8 km drainage canal, part of areported total planned 60 km, the organizations submitted the results of satellite images that were overlaid with the map of the Indonesian Peatland Restoration Agency.  Peatland drainage by digging canals was one of the biggest drivers of the 2015 forest fires crisis. Sungai Putri will suffer the same fate if this development is not stopped by the time the 2017 dry season arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, Director of Wetlands International Indonesia, Nyoman Suryadiputra said: "PT MPK’s decision to use this canal to dry peat in ​​a carbon-rich forest has made this land vulnerable to fires in the next dry season. This action clearly contradicts the restoration initiatives that have been echoed by President Widodo and Dr Siti Nurbaya".&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace Indonesia Statement
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jakarta, 5 May, 2017 -- The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) has &lt;a href="http://www.rspo.org/files/download/be0e9f379932f0b"&gt;threatened to suspend Goodhope Asia Holdings Ltd&lt;/a&gt;, a controversial palm oil company run by the RSPO Vice President Edi Suhardi. Goodhope has been accused by NGOs and local communities of illegal deforestation and human rights abuses in Papua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This follows a &lt;a href="/seasia/Global/seasia/2017/RSPO_BoG_letter_re_Goodhope_7_April_2017.pdf"&gt;joint complaint &lt;/a&gt;by Greenpeace, FPP, Pusaka and EIA last month. Last year, Papuan NGO Pusaka lodged a &lt;a href="http://www.rspo.org/files/download/96a1232fdd8dd68"&gt;formal complaint against Goodhope&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of local people, claiming that the company had taken their land without consent and destroyed their sago farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Several major palm oil traders, including Wilmar International, Archer Daniels Midlands and Musim Mas, are believed to have supplied Goodhope’s palm oil to international brands including Nestlé, Reckitt Benckiser, PepsiCo, P&amp;amp;G, General Mills and Unilever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“After sitting on its hands for months, the RSPO has finally confirmed Goodhope’s operations are rotten to the core. This is a wake up call for the market. Wilmar International and many other traders have been far too complacent. They kept insisting that Goodhope was on the road to reform even as its bulldozers were clearing rainforest in Papua,” said Annisa Rahmawati, Senior Forest Campaigner at Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The RSPO has issued a ‘stop work order’ covering seven Goodhope concessions in Indonesia, noting that its environmental assessments were ‘poor quality’ and that Goodhope had failed to explain how it had obtained the consent of local communities to develop its plantations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The RSPO has ordered Goodhope to revise environmental assessments for all seven plantations and threatened to suspend or expel the company if it fails to do so. The first two assessments must be revised by the end of July 2017, with others to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The RSPO’s actions offer a template that traders and their customers must follow. It has given Goodhope clear deadlines and will suspend or expel the company if it fails to deliver. Wilmar and other traders must now publish their own time-bound milestones for Goodhope and other destructive palm oil companies to meet and exclude any suppliers that refuse to reform,” said Annisa.&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 4 May 2017 – During the six years since its declaration, the area protected under Indonesia’s moratorium on new licenses in primary forest and peatland has undergone ten revisions, which saw it cut by 2.7 million hectares, an area around five times the size of Bali. During this time, fires and deforestation have also ravaged those areas which retained protected status.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With the moratorium due to expire on May 13, the Civil Society Coalition to Save Indonesia’s Forests and the Global Climate today presented its evaluation of the policy’s shortcomings, and urged the President to take concrete steps committing to ‘Zero Deforestation by 2020’. The steps include issuing a presidential regulation to replace the current Presidential Instruction, which is legally unenforceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The moratorium should be protecting an increasingly broad area of forest and peatland, but the reality has been a dwindling area under protection, through a decision-making process which remains obscure. A lack of government transparency in forest management is the main reason why the moratorium policy has been ineffective,” said Linda Rosalina from Forest Watch Indonesia.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Over the past few decades, deforestation has led to environmental disaster, with serious impacts on public welfare. Forest and peat fires are an annual scourge, with the last three months of 2015 bringing deadly air pollution to catastrophic new highs. The Government of Indonesia initially stated its commitment to improve forest and peatland governance through Presidential Instruction No. 10 of 2011 on Suspension of Issuance of New Licenses and Improvement of Governance of Primary Natural Forest and Peatland. That two-year moratorium was merely extended without improvements via Presidential Instruction No. 6 of 2013, and most recently through Presidential Instruction No. 8 of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“In practice, although it has been in place for six years, the moratorium has not been able to address problems in primary forest and peatland governance. The policy has been only partially implemented and has not brought significant improvements in protection of remaining natural forest and peatland,” said Yustina Murdiningrum from Epistema Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Zainuri Hasyim from Kaoem Telapak said that during 2015, 69,044 fire hotspots were detected across Indonesia via satellite. Of those, around 31% (21,552 hotspots) were burning in areas which should have been protected under the Moratorium Indicative Map (PIPPIB). Zainuri pointed to an upward trend over the years from 2011 to 2016, during which time an average 28.5% of hotspots were detected inside moratorium areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the meantime, even as the area of land encompassed by the Moratorium Indicative Map shrank from Revision I to Revision XI, the policy has failed to stem deforestation. Within the remaining ostensibly protected area, deforestation processes have seen actual forest cover decrease by 831,053 hectares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Another problem pertains to the inclusion of community-managed forest areas within the Moratorium Indicative Map. Their inclusion has the potential to threaten existing social forestry licenses and hamper issuance of new licenses, which recognize the right of local communities to sustainable forest management. This impedes realization of the president’s social forestry target of 12.7 million hectares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The status of forest areas is still being redesignated to make way for mega projects in many regions. This is a threat not only to forests and peatlands but also the rights of indigenous people and local communities,” said Yoseph Watopa from YALI Papua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The moratorium has failed to stop deforestation and address problems in primary natural forest and peatland governance because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Declared only via Presidential Instructions, the forest moratorium lacks the force of law and bears no legal consequences if violated;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources are not referenced in Presidential Instructions 10/2011, 6/2013, and 8/2015. They must be included as instructed parties given the expansion of mining and plantations into forest areas;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The policy does not protect secondary forests, even though these now comprise much of Indonesia’s good remaining forest cover. Instead, most of the current moratorium covers areas already legally off-limits, such as conservation areas and protection forest (hutan lindung);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The policy has serious loopholes in the form of exceptions that weaken the objective of suspending further deforestation. Exception is made for forest-clearing proposals that have already obtained ‘in-principle’ approvals, infrastructure projects, and for extension of forest exploitation or forest use licenses as long as they are still valid;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A refusal to release to the public maps and information regarding forest and natural resources management, and a lack of transparency in the process of repeatedly revising the Moratorium Indicative Map; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Different interpretations regarding what constitutes peatland between regional governments and the technical implementing unit of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, resulting in exclusion of peatland areas that should be protected from the Indicative Map of Moratorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Forests are critical for the sustainability of Indonesia’s economy and are the last stronghold mitigating environmental and global climate disasters. Bearing this in mind, the Coalition fully supports the President of Indonesia and urges him to strengthen his commitment to forest and peatland ecosystem protection by issuing a Presidential Regulation to ensure a stronger legal basis. The Coalition also urges the President and other stakeholders to take the following strategic measures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Develop an Indonesian Roadmap Towards Zero Deforestation by 2020;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Develop a National Action Plan Towards Zero Deforestation by 2020;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Monitor the implementation of the National Action Plan Towards Zero Deforestation by 2020;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Accelerate publication of the One Map;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Conduct an integrated evaluation of existing licenses in forest areas; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Conduct law enforcement and alternative dispute resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“These six strategic measures would constitute a positive, strong and measurable signal from the Indonesian Government to the world, a concrete step towards implementing President Jokowi’s Paris promise of 2015 to end tropical forest destruction,” said Teguh Surya from Yayasan Madani Berkelanjutan.      [ENDS]&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace welcomes a new Indonesian government policy immediately banning clearance and exploitation of peatland across Indonesia, and requiring drainage canals to be blocked to raise groundwater levels close to the peat surface, to avoid peat fires. The new policy also bans new planting in burned areas, instead requiring restoration and where appropriate, criminal investigations into fires. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Greenpeace calls on pulp and palm oil companies to implement the new government instructions, warning that the landmark initiative will fail without support from all levels of government and industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decades of deforestation and peatland development are the root causes of Indonesia’s forest and peatland fire crisis, which has created devastating health and environmental impacts across the region. On 24 October, President Joko Widodo issued instructions to tackle forest fires by banning further development on peatland.[1]  On November 3 and 5, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry published formal instructions to all plantation companies ordering them to end any further expansion into peatlands.[2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuyun Indradi, forests political campaigner at Greenpeace Indonesia, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Jokowi is right to seek to prevent next year’s fires by banning further expansion into peatlands, and requiring peat drainage canals be blocked. It is also just that the government has declared burned areas must be rehabilitated rather than planted. But this will only succeed if all levels of government across Indonesia are willing to play their part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The policy must be made practical with a clear timeline for implementation, and given teeth through sanctions for non-compliance. And unless palm oil and pulp companies release data and maps showing the land they control, how can we hold them to account if they ignore the President by continuing to destroy peatlands?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive ban on expansion into peatland builds on the existing moratorium which bans new plantation permits in peatlands. The ban now covers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;All new land clearing on peatlands, even within existing plantation concession areas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;All new land clearing including the use of fire for plantations[3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Any new plantation establishment on areas that have been burnt during the recent fires, earmarking these areas for forest restoration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indonesian government has already agreed a moratorium on new concession licences on peatland. But this is often ignored by local government, especially at the district level, where land allocation is often linked with corruption. Publicly accessible land tenure maps are therefore critical to allow civil society and the public to monitor how the President’s peatland ban is implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last two months, emissions from Indonesia’s peatland fires have surpassed those of the entire US economy on many days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuyun continued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Jokowi’s landmark decision to ban peatland development is a first step toward a cleaner, brighter future for Indonesia’s people and environment. It sets the bar for meaningful commitments from world leaders to tackle the root causes of climate change at the Paris climate summit. Companies must work together with the Indonesian government to implement these decrees and ensure they stop doing business with any company that continues forest and peatland destruction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on companies and government to support President Jokowi’s bold initiative by taking five simple steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Stop the destruction: Companies must insist that their suppliers protect forests and peatlands in Indonesia (including through rapid interventions to prevent fires).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ensure transparency and accountability: Land tenure and forest cover maps must be published, and companies must work together to ensure that suppliers are properly monitored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Clean up trade: Traders must collaborate through industry-wide action to ensure that any company that continues to create the conditions for fires and haze by draining peatlands and destroying forest is locked out of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Clean up the mess: Any forest lost to the fires must be restored. Further restoration efforts must prioritise the vulnerable forest peatland areas that have borne the brunt of the fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Start the solution: Incentives and benefits must be provided for communities to develop livelihoods that support forest conservation and restoration. These include improved yields within existing plantation areas and support for the establishment of cooperative schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	Jakarta, 12 Nov 2015 — Greenpeace accompanied by public interest lawyers today announced a legal case demanding the government make public detailed digital maps of who controls Indonesia’s forest areas. Greenpeace’s official request to put this crucial information into the public domain under the Freedom of Information law began on 8 September 2015, and after an initial refusal and subsequent appeal, may run as far as the Supreme Court. Greenpeace also introduced on Thursday a number of public figures who are supporting the transparency push.[1]
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Teguh Surya, forest campaigner at Greenpeace Indonesia said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Indonesia is currently trying to recover from months of devastating fires and toxic smoke haze. Everyone, including the president, acknowledges this was triggered by widespread forest clearing and peatland drainage for plantations. Public support for the “Kepo itu Baik” (Curiosity is Good) movement shows that Indonesians from public figures to thousands of ordinary people understand they have the right to know what is happening to their forests. Yet the government still refuses our request to release the maps in the digital form needed to analyse which companies are profiting from ongoing forest clearing and peat draining that makes each year’s fires worse than the last.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refusing to accept the government’s refusal, Greenpeace is pleased to announce that noted public interest law firm Widjojanto, Sonhaji &amp;amp; Associates have signed on as advocates in this FOI case. Lawyer Iskandar Sonhaji, S.H. said, “We will pursue these maps, as far as the nation’s highest court, if needs be, because the public has the right to know who controls land in Indonesia. Millions of people were impacted by months of smoke this year — they have the right to this information which is crucial to ensuring we don’t see a repeat of this year’s devastating fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia has a serious problem with corruption in forest-based industries. The KPK reports that the nation has about lost $9 billion over the past decade due to illegal operations in forests.[2] As the saying goes, ‘sunlight is the best disinfectant’ - these maps are key to combating corruption through transparency,” said Iskandar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerned about the impacts of the fires, last month Faried M. Badjeber and Ahmad Afandi of rock band Boomerang travelled with Greenpeace to Central Kalimantan, and bore witness to the human suffering and environmental destruction. Vocalist and guitarist for Boomerang, Ahmad Afandi (Andi Babas) said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the years we’ve enjoyed touring across the country. But our tour of the forest and peat fires heartland was something else entirely. We’ve never seen such tragic and unnecessary suffering. All of us owe a debt to this land that raised us, to look after it, its people and its irreplaceable forests and wildlife. Being Kepo is a good thing, when it’s what’s needed to turn the tide of forest destruction.”&lt;/p&gt;

	The IOI Group, one of the world’s largest palm oil traders, has today made a significant commitment to address deforestation and exploitation throughout its supply chain. [1] Greenpeace has suspended its active campaign to give IOI time to show it is serious about reform. 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement comes one year after the Malaysian company was suspended from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) for clearing peatlands in Kalimantan, Indonesia. [2] Dozens of companies including Unilever, Mars and Nestlé cancelled contracts with IOI as a result. [3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If properly implemented, IOI’s commitments would be a significant step towards eliminating deforestation and exploitation in the palm oil industry. IOI has agreed to independent third party verification of its progress in one year’s time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiki Taufik, Global Head of Greenpeace's Indonesian Forests Campaign, said:&lt;br&gt;“IOI has come a long way in the past twelve months, and has now started taking meaningful action to eliminate forest destruction and human rights abuses from its supply chain. Greenpeace will be watching closely to make sure IOI follows through. There is still a lot of work to be done to clean up the palm oil industry and we expect other traders to respond with action plans of their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since January, IOI has begun proactively monitoring its palm oil suppliers to ensure they are not destroying rainforests or peatlands. It has agreed to work with NGOs to find a solution to the social conflict between the communities of Long Teran Kanan and the IOI-Pelita joint venture in Sarawak, Malaysia. [4] IOI also committed to change its practices to respect the rights of plantation workers and has commissioned a consultant to verify its progress on labour issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace advises companies intending to resume trade with IOI to specify in their contracts that the company must demonstrate ongoing progress in line with its Sustainable Palm Oil Policy and the additional commitments it has made today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palm oil is the most widely-used vegetable oil in the world, but the industry has a well-deserved reputation for rainforest destruction and human rights abuses. [5] The major palm oil traders have ‘no deforestation’ policies, but have done little to ensure their suppliers meet these standards. [6] As a result, many household brands are still supplied by palm oil growers that destroy rainforests or exploit workers and local communities. [7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Consumers have had enough of the palm oil industry failing to deliver. Companies cannot keep ignoring forest destruction and human rights abuses. The only way to clean up the industry is for other palm oil traders to follow IOI’s lead and start cutting off suppliers that destroy rainforests or abuse workers.” said Taufik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past ten years, dozens of civil society organisations have been pushing IOI to reform. [8] A complaint from NGO AidEnvironment led to the company being suspended from the RSPO in April 2016. Hundreds of thousands of Greenpeace supporters took part in the campaign, which included a blockade of IOI’s palm oil refinery in Rotterdam. [9]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Malaysia, Greenpeace activists and members of Malaysian civil society delivered a global petition signed by 300,000 people to the IOI headquarter in Putra Jaya, 5 October 2016."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on other palm oil traders, such as Wilmar International and Golden Agri Resources, to publish similar plans to identify suppliers that are clearing forests, draining peatlands or exploiting workers and exclude those that won’t reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that buy palm oil should require their suppliers to demonstrate how they will ensure deforestation and other unacceptable practices are eliminated from their supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In March 2015, NGO AidEnvironment submitted a formal complaint to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) regarding the destruction of High Conservation Value forests and peatlands in IOI’s plantations in Kalimantan, Indonesia. The RSPO suspended IOI in April 2016, although it lifted the suspension in August 2016. AidEnvironment and IOI published a joint statement in December 2016 declaring the case resolved.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In November 2016, an investigation by Amnesty International found human rights abuses, including child labour, in plantations controlled by Wilmar International, the world’s largest palm oil trader:  &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/11/palm-oil-global-brands-profiting-from-child-and-forced-labour/"&gt;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/11/palm-oil-global-brands-profiting-from-child-and-forced-labour/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	JAKARTA, 25 July 2017 –  The new Presidential Instruction on Delays and Completion of New Permit for Primary Forest and Peatland shows no improvement in law enforcement and will not address Indonesia’s international climate commitments. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace Indonesia Forest Campaigner Ratri &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kusumohartono said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We understand President Jokowi ‘s intention to promote business in Indonesia as he emphasized yesterday &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;during the Plenary Cabinet meeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, but measures to protect forests and stop forest fires should be equally important to his administration”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This new  moratorium comes in two months late and does not address the weaknesses in the previous version, and still has not provided strong protection to Indonesian forests and peatland . There is no official report that probes progress has been accomplished after six years of successive moratorium instructions implemented by different government bodies. Transparency procedures are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;critical for informed decision-making, key elements for monitoring of public actions, and crucial for holding companies accountable”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A review issued in May 2017 by a coalition of  NGOs, including Greenpeace, JKPP, Forest Watch Indonesia, Epistema, and Kaoem Telapak,  shows that at least 2.7 million hectares of primary natural forest and peatland  - five times the size of Bali- disappeared from the moratorium maps during the last six years of implementation of the last Moratorium policy. [1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Encouraging business over forests protection is bad deal for Indonesia. Several hot spots have already been identified this year and it’s been already proven that the lack of law enforcement could end in an humanitarian catastrophe and huge economic loss to the country, as we experienced during the tragic events of 2015 that cost lives and billions to the economy”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;During 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, President Joko Widodo made public and international commitments to reduce its emissions as well as taking concrete actions towards peatland restoration and reviewing  permits and moratoriums. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta- A Greenpeace Belgium campaigner and ornithologist, together with researchers from the University of Singapore and the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, have described a new species of bird on Rote Island, Indonesia. 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Rote myzomela (&lt;em&gt;Myzomela irianawidodoae)&lt;/em&gt; belongs to the colourful honeyeater family and is named after the First Lady of Indonesia, Iriana Joko Widodo.The team’s findings were published in the Indonesian scientific journal, &lt;em&gt;Treubia&lt;/em&gt;, in December 2017.[1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indonesia has over 1500 species of birds and new birds are still being discovered every year. In the past, hardly any birdwatchers visited Rote Island because no endemic bird species were known to live there,” saidGreenpeace campaigner Philippe Verbelen, who undertook fieldwork on the island that led to this discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most bird species have a distinctive song that is unique to that species. Only a handful of new bird species are identified every year. Getting them this proper scientific recognition is hugely rewarding for any birdwatcher,” said Verbelen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesian forests are threatened by industrial and agricultural development [2] and the Rote Island landscape is no exception. The habitat of this new honeyeater species is at risk and needs protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hope the discovery of this new bird will remind people that these forests are critical to the survival not only of birds like this new honeyeater but also tigers, orangutans and other wildlife yet undocumented. Authorities in Jakarta should take note and strengthen efforts  to protect and conserve Rote Island and other remaining forests in Indonesia,” said Verbelen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, nearly 20 years after the bird was first observed by the Australian ornithologist Ron Johnstone, Verbelen visited Rote Island as part of a larger project to study owl vocalisations in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He photographed the myzomela birds on the island and extensively recorded their song and call. He realised that their song was significantly different to that of the &lt;em&gt;myzomelas &lt;/em&gt;on neighbouring Indonesian islands and Australia. [3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verbelen returned to Indonesia in 2014 for further field trips to Rote and Sumba islands. He collected more sound recordings of the birds on both islands to check the hypothesis that despite its similar appearance, the Rote Island bird was likely to be a new species.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new species was scientifically documented by researchers from the University of Singapore and the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), who went to Rote Island in December 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 22 August 2017 - Greatly improved official orangutan survey figures released today provide a clearer picture of the plight of the species in Borneo, where the great apes are now thought to number only an estimated 0.13 to 0.47 individuals per square kilometer, down from the 2004 estimated density of around 0.45 to 0.76 per km2.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The new Orangutan Population and Habitat Viability Assessment, which the government says was carried out in much greater detail than ever before and over a larger area, found that of the 52 orangutan meta-populations surviving across Sumatra and Borneo, only around a third (38%) are expected to remain viable over a 100 to 500-year time frame. [1] Habitat destruction and fragmentation is the primary cause of the great ape’s decline. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Last year, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) placed the Borneo Orangutan in the “critically endangered” category following the devastating fires of 2015 which stemmed from forest clearance and peatland drainage carried out by plantation companies. [3] Orangutans are a protected species under Indonesian law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Greenpeace Forest Campaigner Ratri Kusumohartono said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The government is clearly failing to protect Indonesia’s most iconic animal species, as companies continue to develop plantations in forests and peatland that are some of the last homes for orangutans. This report adds to the already compelling evidence that all deforestation in forests mapped as orangutan habitat must stop immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For years, both palm oil and paper pulp industries have built canal networks across Indonesia’s vast peatlands to drain them for plantations. This peatland drainage is considered one of the important factors in Indonesia's 2015 fire crisis. President Joko Widodo stated in late 2015 that his Government would end the issuing of licences on peatland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;However, these measures have not been able to provide sufficient protection to orangutans, as companies continue their expansion in places like Sungai Putri, a 55 thousand hectare peatland forest that is home to between 800 and 1200 orangutans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Early this year Greenpeace presented evidence that the Sungai Putri orangutan population, thought to be among the largest in Indonesia, is threatened by logging company PT Mohairson Pawan Khatulistiwa (MPK), who opened a new unlawful drainage canal on peatland. Whilst the Government claims to have stopped the development, the drainage canal remains in place and in the last two weeks some activities have restarted in this concession. [4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“No restoration progress has been made, while fires are already breaking across West Kalimantan. The Government must revoke the license of PT MPK immediately. Protecting this landscape is vital both for preventing the fires of the future and to save Indonesia’s crucial orangutan habitats”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The assessment released today takes into account around 16 million hectares of orangutan habitat across Borneo to calculate an estimated Borneo Orangutan population of 57,000, and improves on what experts say was an underestimate of 55,000 produced in 2004, when a more simplistic survey methodology was used over a smaller area of around 8 million hectares.&lt;/p&gt;

	The year 2016 was a year of uncertainties. But it will go down in history as a year of resistance when hundreds of thousands stood together to defend their rights. 2016 was just the beginning. People are rising up. I share the belief that a revolution is underway.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 3px; float: left;" src="/seasia/PageFiles/780649/gpsea2016_AnnualReport_cover.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="325"&gt;Here in our region, Greenpeace was at the forefront of Southeast Asia’s growing civic movement, supporting grassroots groups and mobilisations in different countries. Our work is gradually building a momentum for citizens to secure the future of their region through the power of many. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This work is not without risks, particularly in the political context of our region. But hope, courage and conviction shine through. Armed with hope, we can dream, armed with courage we act, and armed with conviction, we will win. Working with grassroots communities has shown time and again that hope, courage and conviction cannot be defeated. And when groups and communities who carry these with them come together, change is inevitable. So we are at the brink although we face unsettling times, we know that we are in the brink of a profound transformation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We at Greenpeace Southeast Asia are helping drive this transformation, one step at a time, armed with the countless acts of courage made by people who are walking together with us in this journey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The legal complaint we filed against fossil fuel companies is gradually changing the playing field for the millions of people impacted by climate change around the globe. Our continued fight against coal-fired power plants in the region is igniting more and more communities to resist this dirty fuel. A major court victory in Indonesia has stepped up the fight against polluting factory discharges. Our work to pressure the world’s largest tuna company to come clean is poised to break ground for a landmark corporate commitment. Our work with communities is changing mindsets and corporate behaviour to ensure stronger forest protection. And a pioneering food policy in the Philippines rooted in ecological agriculture may soon be underway. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The journey has not been easy, nor do we expect it to be easy in the years to come. For many people, myself included, this is a very personal journey. But throughout this struggle, I have been constantly inspired by modern-day heroes; ordinary people who have done the extraordinary. The collective power of all these people is tremendous. And when they rise up to resist the status quo and act to make a green and peaceful future possible, we know that the future of our planet and its people are in good hands. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for being with us in this journey toward a green and peaceful world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeb Saño &lt;br&gt;Executive Director &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace Southeast Asia&lt;/p&gt;

	London, UK- A palm oil supplier to Mars, Nestlé, PepsiCo and Unilever is destroying rainforests in Papua, Indonesia, a new investigation by Greenpeace International has revealed. [1] Satellite analysis suggests that around 4,000ha of rainforest were cleared in PT Megakarya Jaya Raya concession between May 2015 and April 2017 – an area almost half the size of Paris.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The findings come as a delegation from the Indonesian government arrives in Europe to defend the palm oil industry, in response to moves by European Parliament to discourage the use of palm oil in biofuels on environmental grounds. Luhut Panjaitan, the Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs of Indonesia is visiting several European cities, including Brussels and Berlin. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After destroying much of the rainforests of Sumatra and Kalimantan, the palm oil industry is now pushing into new frontiers like Papua. If the Indonesian government wants to defend this industry, the best thing it can do is to force it to clean up its act, not threaten to start a trade war,” said Richard George, forests campaigner at Greenpeace UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photos and video taken in March and April 2018 show massive deforestation in PT MJR, a palm oil concession controlled by the Hayel Saeed Anam Group (HSA), [3] including in an area zoned for protection by the Indonesian government in response to the devastating forest fires in 2015. Development is prohibited in these areas. [4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although PT MJR is not yet producing palm oil, two other HSA subsidiary companies – Arma Group and Pacific Oils &amp;amp; Fats – supplied palm oil to Mars, Nestlé, PepsiCo and Unilever, according to supply chain information released by the brands earlier this year. [5] Each of these consumer companies has published a ‘no deforestation, no peat, no exploitation’ policy that   should prohibit sourcing from rainforest destroyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Brands have been talking about cleaning up their palm oil for over a decade. Companies like Unilever and Nestlé claim to be industry leaders. So why are they still buying from forest&lt;br&gt; destroyers like the HSA group? What are their customers supposed to think? What will it take to get them to act?”, said Richard George.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case also raises serious questions for the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Many HSA Group palm oil companies are members of the RSPO, although PT MJR and the other HSA Group concessions in this district are not. Members of the RSPO are not allowed to have unaffiliated palm oil divisions, and the development witnessed in PT MJR would also violate several of the RSPO’s Principles and Criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2] &lt;a href="https://finance.detik.com/industri/d-3933552/jokowi-utus-luhut-ke-eropa-bereskan-kampanye-hitam-sawit-ri"&gt;According to Indonesian media&lt;/a&gt;, Minister Luhut will be in Europe starting on 23 April and visit Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. Minister Luhut has &lt;a href="https://en.tempo.co/read/news/2015/11/26/056722592/GAPKI-Wants-Palm-Oil-to-beListed-as-a-Strategic-Commodity"&gt;expressed strong views about the palm oil industry&lt;/a&gt; and the role of civil society. In 2015, he stated that the&lt;em&gt;‘country should expel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; NGOs that disrupt the palm oil industry, which is of National Importance&lt;/em&gt;’.  He &lt;a href="https://en.tempo.co/read/news/2015/11/26/056722592/GAPKI-Wants-Palm-Oil-to-beListed-as-a-Strategic-Commodity"&gt;went on to say&lt;/a&gt; that ‘&lt;em&gt;Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) talk about how the industry is killing off our monkeys &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;– I say, the government will not hesitate to ban NGOs from embarking on these smear campaigns against the industry, which is harmful to the stability of the nation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[3] The Hayel Saeed Anam Group (HSA) is a large Yemeni privately-owned conglomerate, owned and managed by the family of founder Hayel Saeed Anam. &lt;a href="http://www.hsagroup.com/our-companies/indonesia.aspx?p=1"&gt;On its website&lt;/a&gt;, HSA states that it has ‘recently purchased 160,000 acres [sic] of Indonesian land to be used for sustainable palm oil cultivation’. HSA does not disclose the concession name(s) or location. However, company deeds show that various members of the Saeed Anam family have &lt;a href="https://chainreactionresearch.com/reports/indonesian-palm-oils-stranded-assets/"&gt;management control of four concessions&lt;/a&gt; in Indonesia’s Papua province – including PT MJR – with a total landbank of 154,527ha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4] In 2016 Indonesia’s Ministry of Forestry and Environment introduced new peatland regulations (Regulation PP 57/2016)  which led to rezoning peatland areas for protection or production.

	Greenpeace’s most recent report into the IOI Group, 'A Deadly Trade-Off', found that IOI had been supplying the global market with palm oil from third party palm oil suppliers linked to human rights abuses, deforestation and peatland degradation.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;IOI’s &lt;a href="http://www.ioigroup.com/Content/NEWS/NewsroomDetails?intNewsID=817"&gt;initial response&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Forests-Reports/A-Deadly-Trade-off/"&gt;A Deadly Trade-Off&lt;/a&gt; was a weak call for collective industry discussions and contained no commitment to cancel trade deals with dirty palm oil suppliers identified in Greenpeace’s investigations. (See &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/Press-Centre/Press-Releases/Time-for-IOI-to-lead-from-the-front/"&gt;our response&lt;/a&gt; for more information.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;IOI has now &lt;a href="http://www.ioigroup.com/Content/NEWS/NewsroomDetails?intNewsID=819"&gt;updated that response&lt;/a&gt;. Although more detailed, this falls short and shows the company still does not understand what it means to be a responsible trader and producer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If IOI were serious about supplying the market with ‘no deforestation’ palm oil, it would have already identified that these producers were in violation of its policies and excluded their oil from its supply chain. It knew that its oil was coming from the producers named in our report because they were listed in its &lt;a href="http://europe.ioiloders.com/taking-responsibility/list-of-mills?%2Ftaking-responsibility%2Flist-of-mills%2F="&gt;mills database&lt;/a&gt;. As our evidence was drawn from reports and information already in the public domain, IOI has no excuse for not knowing what these companies were up to - or taking appropriate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, it is using the complexity of its own supply chain as an excuse to blame other companies for its own failings. This is just passing the buck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IOI claims to have been aware of problems associated with the one company, TH Plantations, with which it deals with directly – but made no efforts to exclude this supplier until Greenpeace exposed the scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IOI is not only responsible for its own plantation operations; it also needs to take responsibility for the actions of the producers whose oil it is trading, regardless of how their oil enters its supply chain. That means leading by example and immediately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Cutting contracts with the companies named in our most recent report&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Resolving outstanding social conflicts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Imposing a moratorium on all new plantation development across its supply chain until its suppliers’ compliance can be verified by independent auditors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Driving full transparency amongst its suppliers by requiring them to publish land use maps in a standard digital format to enable analysis, monitoring and compliance checks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Engaging other stakeholders in the plantation sector to share and use these tools and standards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Proactively monitoring suppliers to check compliance and establish a clear, time-bound route for excluding rogue companies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	Bangkok, 8 November 2016 -- Following a year of intensive work, the HCS Convergence Working Group announced in Bangkok that they have reached agreement on convergence between the HCSA and HCS+ approaches (see attached).   The Group has agreed on a single, coherent set of principles for implementation of companies’ commitments to “no deforestation” in their palm oil operations and supply chains.  The members of the Group worked together constructively to develop recommendations that  provide a roadmap forward for addressing the issues that remain in a collaborative and integrated way. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div class="WordSection1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement outlines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundamental elements of the converged methodology that protects HCS forests, HCV areas and peatlands, including forest stratification and decision-making in "young regenerating forest" within fragmented landscapes, the role of carbon and robust implementation of FPIC and other social requirements;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The intention for functional and institutional integration of HCS with the HCV Resource Network; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A roadmap for resolving outstanding issues through a collaborative process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="BulletList"&gt; The recommendations will be incorporated into the revised HCSA Toolkit and the members of the Group are committed to further the implementation of these recommendations and to address the important remaining issues through their engagement in the HCSA Steering Group.  In addition, the agreement will be reflected in the policies and positions of the organizations endorsing this agreement and the revised HCSA toolkit will be implemented by the companies when it is issued in early 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Organizations reaching agreement are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Asian Agri                                                                   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="WordSection2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargill                                                                           &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forest Peoples Programme                                &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golden Agri-Resources                                        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace                                                              &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IOI Corporation Berhad                                        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KLK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musim Mas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rainforest Action Network                                 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sime Darby                                                                &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TFT                                                                                &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unilever                                                                      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union of Concerned Scientists                          &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilmar International                                             &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WWF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This agreement has also been received and endorsed by Executive Committee of the HCSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Quotes from a number of the participating organizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “This is a significant milestone for the palm oil industry to enable us to meet our "no deforestation" commitments. This initiative is a clear demonstration of what is possible when all parties collaborate openly. While we recognise there are issues that need to be further addressed, such as balancing the socio-economic development needs in highly forested landscapes, we are committed to working through these with the other members of the HCS Steering Group,” said Datuk Franki Anthony Dass, Managing Director, Sime Darby Plantation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; "Agreeing a single approach to put No Deforestation into practice is a huge step forward for the palm oil sector and the environment. HCS convergence has not been an easy road but we got there in the end - this is a game changer for the forests and communities where oil palm is expanding in Asia and Africa," said Kiki Taufik, Global Head of Indonesian Forests, Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; "The Agreement is a significant step in uniting the palm oil industry and all its stakeholders toward a common understanding about how to protect forests and peatlands. More importantly, it will lead to collaborative and concrete actions on the ground toward achieving this goal” said Dato' Lee's Yeow Chor, Group CEO, IOI Corporation Berhad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Jeremy Goon, Chief Sustainability Officer, Wilmar said, “Recognising the importance of having a unified HCS methodology, in 2014 – 2015 Wilmar joined the HCS+ scientific study despite not being a signatory to the Palm Oil Manifesto (SPOM). Wilmar was already a member of the HCS Approach (HCSA) Steering Committee. With the intent of bridging the differences between the HCSA and HCS+, we actively contributed to the convergence process.  Wilmar is very pleased that the efforts of stakeholders representing these two groups have now resulted in agreement and a unified approach to the application of No Deforestation commitments by palm oil companies.  We look forward to having more plantation companies commit to zero deforestation and join us in making palm oil a sustainable, globally acceptable and competitive product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “Rainforest Action Network supports this foundation-laying agreement between the major players in the industry to finally break the link between palm oil and deforestation in Southeast Asia,” said Gemma Tillack, Agribusiness Campaign Director, Rainforest Action Network (RAN). “This new found consensus is a recognition by all parties of the urgent need to protect forests and peatlands while upholding community land rights. It’s now critical no more time is wasted turning these words into action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “As an early adopter of the HCS Approach Golden Agri-Resources is delighted to support this HCS convergence agreement and the development of a single pathway for the identification and protection of forests,” said Götz Martin, Head of Sustainability Implementation, Sinarmas Agribusiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Dhaval Buch, Chief Procurement Officer, Unilever said  “Unilever supports the foundation work laid out in the HCS convergence agreement. We encourage all growers and users of palm oil to adopt this methodology and move to implementation. Unilever recognizes the next big challenges would be to ensure the application of HCS in high forest landscapes and with smallholders and support the industry to move swiftly to find a pathway forward for these issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="BulletList"&gt; “It’s a historic day for forests, communities and for businesses”, says Bastien Sachet, CEO, TFT. “This agreement means there is now a single common practical tool that brings together those who want to conserve forests and develop responsibly, maximizing benefits for Nature and People”. “It’s the kind of win-win achievement that only high level mutual trust can bring and that we all need today to face climate change and a rising population.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We welcome the agreement that the converged High Carbon Stock method will include Social Requirements to ensure that the rights and livelihoods of indigenous peoples, local communities, smallholders and workers are properly accommodated. Respect for customary rights, food security, community involvement in land use planning and free, prior and informed consent are critical building blocks to ensure sound development outcomes, alongside incentives and support, for both communities and planters, to maintain forests and high conservation values, said Marcus Colchester of the Forest Peoples Programme. Our next challenge is to develop credible systems to ensure high quality assessments, independent verification and means of redress, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Dr. Petra Meekers, Director of Sustainable Development and CSR, Musim Mas said, “Musim Mas is pleased with the outcome of this important process. We believe that this outcome can be supported by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) as the HCS tool. It is also our aspiration to look at an inclusive pathway that will address the aspirations of local communities and the smallholders too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “This agreement is an important step towards defining what zero deforestation actually means on the ground. We need to make sure it is adopted far beyond the palm oil industry by the other sectors that have been driving deforestation around the world,” said Aditya Bayunanda, Forest Commodity Leader, WWF-Indonesia. “Now we have to fully integrate HCS and HCV and clearly define how they are applied beyond the fragmented moist tropical landscapes for which the approach was developed.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta: Greenpeace congratulates Asia Pulp &amp; Paper (APP) on taking a decision to immediately retire around 7,000 hectares of existing acacia plantations located in two of Sumatra’s threatened peat swamp forest landscapes. This decision follows the first round of rapid assessment management recommendations delivered by APP’s independent peat expert team, which is led by the Dutch organisation Deltares.(1)
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Further, Greenpeace commends both APP and Deltares for their groundbreaking and unprecedented initiative to create new high-tech maps of the peatland landscapes, where APP suppliers are located. Covering some 5 million&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hectares – nearly 25% of Indonesia’s peatlands, an area larger than The Netherlands – the mapping initiative features LiDAR technology to build an accurate picture of the major peat domes that need protecting. This constitutes the most comprehensive and credible data on peatlands ever obtained in Indonesia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The resulting analysis will provide the foundation Deltares needs to make additional recommendations to APP on how to reduce or reverse the identified impacts of its existing plantations on neighbouring peat swamp forests, as well as greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bustar Maitar said, “Today’s announcement by APP is a potential game changer for the future of Indonesia’s peatland landscapes and tangible action to tackle climate change. Its announcement that it is taking immediate action to retire a number of existing commercial plantation areas and restore them to peat swamp forests sets an important benchmark. Greenpeace calls on other plantation companies to take similar urgent action and work together to ensure all Indonesia’s peatland landscapes are properly monitored and protected.”  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;APP’s action to protect and restore peatland impacted by its operations is part of a wider company pledge, supporting global efforts to restore forests and reduce GHG emissions, which assists the Government of Indonesia’s target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 41%. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bustar Maitar continued: “Greenpeace calls on the government to ensure it is not undermining conservation initiatives by progressive companies. For initiatives such as APP’s to succeed, not only do all companies and the surrounding communities need to work together, but the government needs to  suspend all further plantation development on forests and peatland.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The protection of Indonesia’s peatland landscapes requires long term commitments and significant investment. APP’s announcement today demonstrates a clear recognition of the urgency to implement a coordinated approach to peatland protection and management. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;APRIL, the other major pulp and paper company in Indonesia, also made commitments earlier this year to protect peatland forests. So far there is little sign of these commitments being translated into credible action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Accurate maps, adequate monitoring systems, and proper laws to enable forest conservation and landscape-level planning are lacking. The initiative led by Deltares and APP should be adopted by the government as the basis for a new model of responsible peatland protection and management.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 8 December 2016 -- Rusmadya Maharuddin, forest campaigner for Greenpeace Indonesia said today that Greenpeace has suspended its engagement with APRIL’s Stakeholder Advisory Committee (SAC) with immediate effect. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;APRIL has repeatedly and consistently misled SAC and its independent peat expert working group regarding the continued construction of canals in its concession areas in Pulau Padang. If the company cannot be trusted to provide accurate, clear and trustworthy information regarding its operations then there is simply no point in continuing to engage with it at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For more than a year Greenpeace has tried to work constructively with APRIL and parent company RGE. We have observed however that a fundamental cultural shift is required on issues like transparency and consistent follow up on all sustainability commitments. At this time the group simply cannot be trusted to deliver on its commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

	Marrakech, 16 November 2016 – Greenpeace Indonesia welcomed a recognition of the importance of forests and renewable energy in today’s climate change speech delivered by the Indonesian Minister of Environment and Forestry. The Indonesian government’s actions however show no real intention to shift away from coal dependence and deforestation. Moreover, it displays an aversion to the transparency required to allow monitoring, and far from aiming for reductions, Indonesia’s emissions targets actually represent an increase in GHG emissions by around one third from 2015 to 2030.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Among policies the Minister points to are the 2011 moratorium on primary forest conversion. This fails to protect many millions of hectares of forest and peatland.  In truth, the government’s own figures show the national deforestation rate is rising.[1] Worse, the government’s UNFCCC documents show the government plans for the continued destruction of 13 million hectares of forests over the next three decades.[2] We are reneging on the 2014 New York Declaration on Forests commitment to strive for zero deforestation by 2030,” said Kiki Taufik, Head of Greenpeace’s Indonesia Forests Campaign.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Another policy mentioned was the long-overdue promise to publish the One Map. Yet ‘transparency’ seems to be a dirty word for the Indonesian government. The Minister is currently fighting in court Indonesian civil society requests for transparency over forest cover and land tenure. Commitments to deliver emissions reductions through forest policy are crucial, yet will be meaningless unless there is full transparency of baseline data and methodology, enabling independent monitoring and accurate calculations about what is actually happening on the ground,” Kiki said. [3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace Indonesia also emphasised that the country’s emission reduction plans remain very weak. The current 35 GW power plan still allocates more than 20 GW for coal. The target for renewables remains 23% by 2025 and 31% by 2050.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hindun Mulaika, team leader for climate and energy campaign, Greenpeace Indonesia, said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Neither of these targets will be achieved with the current mindset and current policies.  There is no encouragement for the development of renewable energies, fossil fuels are still subsidised and the coal lobby wields a dangerous influence over government thinking.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Fossil fuel developments need to stop now.  There is no room for more coal fired power plants.  Yet Indonesia continues to invest in these deadly dinosaurs, threatening the quality of our air, the health of Indonesians and the future of our planet. The government's plan for 25% of energy to come from coal as late as 2050 may well turn out to be a fiction.  With the current policies, coal’s share is likely to be much more than that.  Indonesia’s energy plans amount to a suicide note for our planet.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Correction: The original media release erroneously stated that the government's target for renewables was 31% by 2030 - the target is in fact 31% by 2050. We regret the error.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;[2] BUR 1-12 identifies around 15.4 million ha of forest available for planned deforestation (as HPK and APL concessions) BUR (4-6); and the NDC sees 450,000ha/yr of planned deforestation in perpetuity.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;[3] Forests and Other Lands are crucial for additional CO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; uptake in order to achieve the 1.5ºC degree target of the Paris Agreement. They need comprehensive, transparent and separate accounting rules facilitating a halt in deforestation and restoring forests and other natural carbon sinks. Developing countries need additional support from the green climate fund and not through offset schemes for this sector. NDCs must step up their forests and land targets, which are not adequate in developing countries and almost non-existent in developed countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Annisa Rahmawati, senior campaigner for Greenpeace Southeast Asia, said:

“A new report by Amnesty International has revealed widespread child and forced labour at plantations controlled by palm oil giant Wilmar International. Wilmar claims to be aware of the problem but instead of taking action it has responded with a meaningless call for the industry to work together. This is just passing the buck.”
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Investigation after investigation has caught palm oil companies profiting from child labour or forest destruction. Yet companies act as though they are the victims. Wilmar and the other palm oil giants must take responsibility for what happens in their supply chains by excluding suppliers that refuse to stop destroying forests or exploiting workers and communities.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, December 9, 2016 - Indonesian Migrant Workers Union (SBMI) and Greenpeace Indonesia today held a peaceful protest in front of the Ministry of Manpower office to urge improvement for placement policies and protection of migrant worker crews from Indonesia working on foreign fishing vessels outside the country. The protest was held one day before the commemoration of International Human Rights Day which is celebrated on 10 December.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Manpower has been deemed negligent in carrying out its obligations to protect Indonesian fishing crews from human trafficking. The safety and rights of Indonesian fishing crews working on foreign fishing vessels abroad are often neglected; most of them are also trapped into illegal fishing activities.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Hariyanto, Chairman of SBMI, said that negligence is exacerbated by overlapping authority between ministries and goverment institutions. As a result, the placement of Indonesian fishermen working on foreign fishing vessels is connected with the practices of human trafficking and slavery on fishing vessels.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Negligence is clearly proved by the inability of the Ministry of Manpower for 12 years to publish the implementing regulations as mandated by Article 28 of Law Number 39 Year 2004 regarding the Placement and Protection of Indonesian Workers (TKI) Abroad. In addition, the Ministry of Manpower also ignores Article 337 of Law Number 17 Year 2008 on Shipping which states that: "The provision of employment in the field of shipping must be carried out in accordance with the legislation in the field of labor."&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; This negligence leads to confusion in governance and protection of migrant workers, whose placement is enabled by the issuance of ABK BNP2TKI Chief Regulation No. 3 of 2013 and the Regulation of the Minister of Transportation No. 84 of 2013. Both of these regulations are contrary to Law Number 13 Year 2003 on Labor and Law Number 39 Year 2004 regarding the Placement and Protection of Indonesian Migrant Workers Abroad. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; The overlapping authority causes various detrimental impacts for migrant workers from Indonesia who work on foreign fishing vessels: (1) fishing vessels crew placement procedures violated; (2) abdicating responsibility for protection and handling of cases of crew members facing problems abroad; and (3) fishing vessel crews trapped into IUU fishing activities.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Currently, Indonesia is the third largest source of maritime labor, with numbers reaching more than 200 thousand workers. Of these, 77 percent are migrant workers who serve as crew on fishing vessels. The rest are workers who serve as crew on cargo ships, cruise ships and more. Although the number is huge, the fate of fishing vessel workers is the least protected and most vulnerable amongst other maritime workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Editor's Note:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to Law No. 39 of 2004 ​​(Article 1), crews working on foreign fishing vessels include migrant workers or Indonesian Workers (TKI) who work abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

	Washington, DC -- Following global pressure on pet food companies, industry giants Mars and Nestlé have announced that they will take steps to ensure their pet food supply chains are free of human rights abuses and illegally caught seafood. Their commitments to act on transshipping at sea increase the need for global seafood giant Thai Union, a supplier for both companies, to eliminate any outstanding risks of human rights abuses and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in its own supply chains. 

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Nestlé has committed to a full ban on transshipment at sea in its supply chains, while Mars has committed to suspend the use of transshipped products in its supply chains if its seafood suppliers cannot adequately address the human rights and illegal fishing issues associated with the practice in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pet owners and activists have demanded that companies eliminate human rights abuses from their pet food supply chains. This move toward stopping out of control transshipment at sea means we’re finally seeing results,” said Greenpeace USA Oceans Campaigner Graham Forbes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are the two largest pet food companies in the world, and their commitments to address transshipping at sea will put significant pressure on suppliers like Thai Union to show the leadership needed to clean up their own seafood supply chains. We’ll be closely monitoring Mars’ and Nestlé’s progress to ensure these policies lead to real changes on the water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace launched a campaign in 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjO06PhZLCo"&gt;Cats vs Bad Tuna&lt;/a&gt;, to demand that Mars ensure its supply chains were free of any potential human rights abuses. A Greenpeace Southeast Asia report, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/Press-Centre/publications/Turn-The-Tide/"&gt;Turn the Tide&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrated the unacceptably high risk of tainted seafood entering numerous supply chains throughout 2016, including Nestlé and Thai Union’s. Nestlé immediately committed to address the concerns when they were raised in the report. Mars committed to tackle unchecked transshipment at sea in its pet food supply chains this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the past several years, Nestlé and Greenpeace have worked together to strengthen Nestlé’s policies governing the procurement and responsible sourcing of seafood,” said &lt;strong&gt;Nestlé Purina PetCare Head of Sustainability Jack Scott&lt;/strong&gt;. “In light of Greenpeace’s research findings, Nestlé has committed to a ban on all transshipments at sea."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transshipment is a process through which companies move fish from one vessel to another, enabling them to remain at sea for extended periods of time to plunder the oceans, dodge regulations, and keep fishers as a captive workforce. In addition to its connections to human rights abuse, transshipment at sea provides an opportunity for illegal fishing vessels to unload their illegally caught loads into supply chains, away from port authorities. In 2015, an estimated 40 percent of these transfers happened on the high seas, outside of the jurisdiction of national authorities. Transshipment at sea has also been linked to other organized crime, including drug, weapon and wildlife trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mars’ and Nestlé’s commitments send a strong message to Thai Union to address transshipment in its supply chains. Greenpeace is currently pressuring Thai Union to make sweeping changes for workers and our oceans across its seafood supply chains. Greenpeace has campaigned on Thai Union since 2015, and is asking the company to lead the seafood industry by ending transshipment at sea, addressing overfishing and destructive fishing and increasing traceability from sea to plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Mars recognises the risks of transshipment at sea. We want to see human rights respected and the environment protected in our seafood supply chains" said &lt;strong&gt;Isabelle Aelvoet, Global Sustainability Director, Mars Petcare&lt;/strong&gt;. "The current problems associated with transshipment are serious and demand urgent attention. We are committed to working with our suppliers to remedy these problems, but if we cannot resolve these issues to our satisfaction quickly, we will seek to end the use of transshipped products in our supply chains until these serious problems are fixed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s news follows &lt;a href="http://blog.globalfishingwatch.org/2017/02/the-first-ever-global-view-of-transshipment-in-commercial-fishing/"&gt;a new report from Global Fishing Watch&lt;/a&gt; highlighting the problems with transshipment at sea. The report found that from 2012-2016, refrigerated cargo vessels participated in more than 5,000 likely transshipments. Concerns were raised about Mars and Nestlé supply chains in a 2015 &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/world/outlaw-ocean-thailand-fishing-sea-slaves-pets.html?_r=1"&gt;New York Times investigation&lt;/a&gt; into human rights abuses at sea. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of the famous internet cats from Greenpeace’s original Cats vs Bad Tuna campaign are featured in a new victory video celebrating the progress in the pet food industry.

	Manila, 11 December 2015 - The Supreme Court of the Philippines has ordered a permanent ban on field trials of genetically engineered (GE) eggplant and a temporary halt on approving applications for the “contained use, import, commercialisation and propagation” of GE crops, including the import of GE products. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The court ruled in favour of Greenpeace Southeast Asia, as well as several Filipino activists, academics and politicians, in what is a major victory for Filipino farmers and activists around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“This decision builds on a wave of countries in Europe rejecting GE crops, and is a major setback for the GE industry,” said Virginia Benosa-Llorin, Ecological Agriculture Campaigner for Greenpeace Philippines. “The Philippines has been used as a model for GE regulatory policy around the world, but now we are finally making progress to give people a right to choose the food they want to eat and the type of agriculture they want to encourage.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The temporary ban is in place until a new ‘administrative order’ takes effect, and includes the highly controversial ‘Golden’ rice, an experimental project by International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) that is currently back at the laboratory stage due to poor performance.[1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Supreme Court decision sets a global precedent as it is the first legal decision on GE in the Philippines using the Writ of Kalikasan (environment) - a legal environmental remedy found only in the Philippines. The court is also the first in the world to adopt the precautionary principle - that it is best to err on the side of caution in the absence of scientific consensus - regarding GE products in their decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“This case vindicates the many cases of genetic contamination we and others have highlighted, as well as the simple fact that there is no scientific consensus on the safety of genetically engineered crops,” said Benosa-Llorin. “It’s a major victory for Filipinos, especially for farmers struggling with incidents of genetic contamination.”[2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“GE crops promote an ineffective farming model based on industrial agriculture, a system that cannot withstand the impacts of a rapidly changing climate, and which is failing to deliver what Filipinos currently need: food and nutritional security in times of erratic weather patterns,” said Benosa-Llorin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The decision of the high court invalidates the Department of Agriculture’s Administrative Order No. 08-2002 (DAO8) and will barr the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Science and Technology from issuing any GE approvals, pending crafting and approval of a new Administrative Order. It will also impact the trade of GE crops and products. In 2014, the United States exported US$784 million worth of GE crops and products to the Philippines.[3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Supreme Court affirmed the May 2013 Court of Appeals order for the government to prepare an immediate plan of action to rehabilitate field trial sites and protect, preserve and conserve the environment, as well as recommending measure to reform the current regulatory process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Greenpeace Southeast Asia calls on the Philippine government to support ecological agriculture policies, investments and funding.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is pleased that the RSPO will next year finally go ahead with its 2013 resolution to publish concession maps of oil palm plantations owned by RSPO grower members. However the plan only covers concessions directly owned by members, rather than the extensive supply base for oil traded by RSPO members. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If the RSPO is serious about ensuring transparency and integrity in the palm oil trade, the measure must be extended to cover RSPO member supply chains. Greenpeace calls on the RSPO to publish maps of all concessions linked to groups supplying RSPO member companies, whether directly owned by members or not. [1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Indonesia’s Annisa Rahmawati said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The RSPO says that three years after a passing a resolution on maps, it will finally publish its members’ concessions. However the major issue remains the maps for those companies that RSPO members, such as IOI Loders Croklaan, buy oil from. Until concession maps are available for all supplier operations, the impact will be very limited, and trade in sustainable palm oil will remain an elusive goal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the maps to be useful as the RSPO intends – not only for fire monitoring, but also to track deforestation and other issues – it is crucial that the data be made available to the public for download in shapefile format. The 2013 RSPO Resolution 6g requires this, but the RSPO’s latest statement does not re-assert this commitment. Furthermore, Greenpeace understands that of the companies that have acted on the resolution, some companies have provided maps in paper, rather than shapefile format; many companies have yet to provide any maps at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace hopes the RSPO will now provide clear guidance to companies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What is the new deadline for companies to comply with Resolution 6g by supplying maps to the RSPO? The original 2013 RSPO Resolution 6g provides a deadline of the 2014 ACOP – now past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Where member companies do not provide their maps to the RSPO by the deadline and in the correct shapefile format, what action will the RSPO take? Will sanctions follow for non-compliance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In order to better meet its objectives, does the RSPO intend to extend Resolution 6g to cover all concessions by groups or individual companies trading with RSPO members?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	Paris, 30 November 2015 - Greenpeace welcomed President Joko Widodo’s promise in Paris to end Indonesia’s recurring forest and peat fires, which regularly made the country the world’s worst carbon polluter in recent months. However, success depends on strong leadership from the president and decisive action to permanently protect Indonesia's forests and peatlands.
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Responding to Indonesian President Joko Widodo’s opening speech at the Paris climate talks, Teguh Surya, Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner said: &lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;“The president has gone halfway towards tackling Indonesia's emissions, but it seems he can’t see the forests for the peat. His landmark pledge to protect and restore peatlands, if given the force of law, could do much towards cutting Indonesia’s emissions. But by failing to announce any new protection for forests, he is allowing the juggernaut of deforestation to roll on, and guaranteeing future bouts of devastating forest fires.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forest and peatland destruction is Indonesia’s largest source of emissions. Since 1990, Indonesia has lost 31 million ha of rainforest, an area nearly the size of Germany. Indonesia currently has the highest rate of deforestation, due in large part to its role as the world’s largest producer of palm oil. Despite the introduction in 2011 of a government-imposed moratorium on granting new plantation or timber concessions on primary forests and peatlands, the national deforestation rate has risen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia holds the key to some of the cheapest, most effective and immediate potential cuts to global GHG emissions -- and that is to invest in forest protection and restoration. I urge the President not to miss the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity in Paris to save Indonesia’s forests and peatlands,” Teguh said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need laws that fully protect forests and peatlands. We need sanctions for anybody who breaks those laws. And we need full transparency about who controls the land and the state of Indonesia’s forests and peatlands. Those are the boxes that need to be ticked if we’re serious about tackling forest fires and climate change in Indonesia.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Palangkaraya, Indonesia, 27 November 2015 — Greenpeace together with CIMTROP and SOB today took bold direct action showing the way towards a future grounded in rainforest and peatland restoration, tackling the causes of this year’s disastrous fires, which for a period made Indonesia the world’s biggest daily greenhouse gas emitter. [1]
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace activists are working side by side with residents, volunteers and local organisations Save our Borneo and the Center for International Cooperation in Sustainable Management of Tropical Peatland (CIMTROP) of Palangkaraya University to begin construction of one of the largest ever community dams to restore peatland.  The dam will close a peatland drainage canal in Central Kalimantan, [2] the epicentre of last month’s forest fires disaster zone. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner Rusmadya Maharuddin said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“By taking up tools to build this dam, we are setting an example based on the instruction to protect peatlands issued by President Joko Widodo ahead of next week’s climate change talks. Damming this canal will restore natural peatland water levels. Forest and peatland destruction, mainly for plantations, is both a major cause of forest fires and the source of Indonesia’s largest contribution to climate change. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We need to see President Jokowi make good on his promise to issue a regulation requiring companies to dam canals and permanently protect peatlands. He must codify zero deforestation in law, by strengthening the existing moratorium on forest and peatland development to include secondary forests and forests inside existing concessions.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Save our Borneo’s Nordin said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Peatland restoration must begin now before next year’s fires come again - we are here to show how urgently everyone must act. Today’s action marks exactly a year since President Jokowi dammed a canal draining a peat island at Sungai Tohor off the coast of Sumatra. That area was largely spared this year’s devastating fires. However because the move was not backed up with binding regulations, the president’s example was largely ignored.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite the Indonesian government’s signature of last year’s New York Declaration on Forests, and a slew of corporate forest protection policies over the past several years, a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Forests-Reports/Under-Fire/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;new Greenpeace report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; [3] shows the plantation industry continues to drive the fire crisis through forest and peatland destruction. Indonesia’s deforestation rate is still rising, clearing for palm oil being the main driver, while worldwide deforestation is responsible for about a sixth of greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prof. Suwido H. Limin from CIMTROP at the University of Palangkaraya said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Blocking this canal is our way of realising the instructions by President Joko Widodo, [4] which reflect what has been urged since 1998 by CIMTROP and international peatland experts. Degraded peatland is a priority for restoration, by returning water levels and planting with local species which do not require dry soils, so that peat does not need to be drained, removing the risk of fires.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Rusmadya added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“This community action is just a first step to end the annual forest fires. We are calling on the plantation sector – and the global companies it supplies – to work together to ban trade with any company that continues to drain peatlands and destroy forests.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	Greenpeace and the Rainforest Action Network consider that the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), along with PEFC-endorsed standards the Indonesian Forest Certification Cooperation (IFCC), the  Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) and the Malaysian Timber Certification Scheme (MTCS), are weak forest certification systems that do not guarantee responsible or sustainable forest management. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;These forestry certification schemes are largely developed by the forestry industry with insufficient stakeholder and NGO involvement and endorsement. They are based on inadequate rules and poor standards and therefore cannot provide assurance that the ecological and social values of forests are being protected [1]. Hence, we believe that any sustainability claims based on these certification schemes is industry ‘greenwash.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent IFCC standard (‘Sustainable Forest Management Requirements’) – endorsed by the PEFC umbrella scheme – has weak rules which allow certification of plantation areas converted prior to 2011 (compared to November 1994 under the Forest Stewardship Council) and there are no provisions to address previous forest clearance by certified companies. It has no specific provisions prohibiting  new plantations on peatland nor addressing the impacts of existing plantations on peat. Furthermore, there are major concerns around the quality of auditing against the IFCC standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Forest Stewardship Council is not perfect, it contains a framework, as well as standards (principles, criteria and indicators) that can guarantee socially and ecologically responsible practices if implemented correctly.  This includes clear requirements to prevent deforestation, protect environmental values and High Conservation Values (HCV) including peatlands, and respect the rights of traditional and indigenous communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ends]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; [1] Through its May 2015 WWF Forest Certification Assessment Tool (CAT), WWF confirmed the inadequacies of PEFC's system and standards, following earlier assessments of PEFC which found it insufficiently protected human rights, stakeholder participation, and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 15 January 2016 - Greenpeace welcomes the establishment of a Peat Restoration Agency for Indonesia, and the appointment of environment activist Nazir Foead to lead the initiative. If peat protection regulations are sufficiently strengthened, Nazir will be in a position to save the country’s precious tropical peatland landscapes, reducing fires and carbon emissions.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Clearing and draining of peatlands for oil palm and pulpwood plantations is a major cause of Indonesia’s recurring fire and haze crisis, which last year impacted the health of millions in South-East Asia and cost Indonesia’s economy an estimated $16.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The establishment of a peat restoration body is a great start. Successful peat protection will depend however on further reforms, including ending secrecy over maps of industry concessions in forests and peatlands, to allow full public participation in monitoring and restoration,” said Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner Teguh Surya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Joko Widodo showed the way to end peatland destruction by personally damming a drainage canal to rewet a peatland area in Riau province in late 2014. However, his initiative faltered due to a lack of policy clarity and coordination. For the new Peat Restoration Agency to overcome the potential hurdle of its limited authority, every level of government must provide full support including coordination and concrete action in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Peat Restoration Agency’s enabling decree targets a very modest 2 million hectares for restoration by 2020. This is far less than the total area of damaged peatland, which the government has vowed to restore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Decree should aim higher than protecting just two million hectares out of more than twenty million hectares of Indonesia’s peatlands. Preventing fires from returning will only be possible if all damaged peatland landscapes are restored, with clear indicators and deadlines,” Teguh said.&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 4 February 2016 -- Greenpeace Indonesia welcomes news that the Indonesia-Norway  bilateral partnership on climate and forests will support the newly created Peatland Restoration Agency, and urges the government to set the Agency an ambitious timeline and empower it properly to get the job done.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The Peatland Restoration Agency (BRG) must hit the ground running so Indonesia is prepared before the fire crisis returns this year. We welcome today’s joint Indonesia-Norway announcement, which means financial resources should be no barrier to reform. We are also pleased that Norway is emphasising the need for transparency and full participation of civil society in peat protection and restoration. However Greenpeace believes President Joko Widodo must revise the legal framework governing forests and peatlands to allow for protection and ensure companies are held accountable to restore damaged landscapes,” said Kiki Taufik, Greenpeace’s Global Lead for the Indonesia Forest Campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiki also commented on the announcement that peat protection regulations would be revised and promulgated by mid-year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no time to lose - June 1st is well into the dry season, far too distant a target for revised peat protection regulations. The Indonesia-Norway ‘results-based climate and forest partnership’ sets targets - let’s make sure they’re ambitious enough to save us from going through another season of forest and peatland fire hell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Jokowi showed much-needed vision with his One Map pledge, delivered during his election campaign and mentioned frequently since. However we don’t see the One Map initiative making much headway. Despite being overseen by the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, it has not been allocated the resources and attention it needs to progress.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Bangkok, 15 December 2016 - A 12-month investigation by Greenpeace Southeast Asia has found that Thailand’s overseas fishing fleets are intentionally shifting to remote waters in order to avoid fishing regulations. The investigation started seven months after the Associated Press released its expose on shocking human rights abuses on Thailand’s notorious fishing industry, and demonstrates a very clear case for banning transshipment at sea.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The Thai government has tried to clamp down on human rights violations in the fishing industry but these Thai fleets remain as ruthless as ever,” said Anchalee Pipattanawattanakul, Oceans Campaigner of Greenpeace Southeast Asia. “Our investigation shows that rather than changing the way they fish to meet the regulations, they are just shifting to isolated and less regulated fishing grounds outside the region.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Between 2014 and 2016 Greenpeace Southeast Asia tracked Thailand’s rogue overseas fishing vessels and found that, after fishing restrictions were imposed by the governments of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea in August 2015, as many as 76 Thai flagged vessels shifted their operations to the environmentally fragile Saya de Malha Bank in the Indian Ocean, more than 7,000km away from Samut Sakhon, Thailand’s seafood epicentre.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maintaining fishing fleets in the distant Saya de Malha Bank requires routine journeys by reefer vessels of over 7,000 km, making transshipment at sea central to the Thai business model. This model allows the fishing vessels to remain at sea and out of reach of authorities, where they can operate outside the law. The reefers deliver supplies and sometimes trafficked workers, and pick up fish, with some shipments reported to include up to a 50% bycatch of sharks [2]/[3].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Turn the Tide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; report also found that the negligent use of trafficked, abused and underpaid local and foreign workers can lead to horrific outcomes such as the outbreak of beriberi disease [4]. An official investigation into six beriberi fatalities concluded that the men had died of heart failure caused by poor nutrition, overwork, and long periods at sea without returning to port, a situation that was enabled by transshipment at sea [5]/[6].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Furthermore, of the 15 trafficked survivors interviewed by Greenpeace Southeast Asia, almost half experienced physical violence on the vessels. One of the main reasons for beatings was illness, especially when there was insufficient food on-board and exhausted crew members would try to sneak off to rest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The powerful Thai Overseas Fishing Association, which controls much of the billion dollar fishing industry, have eroded trust in their willingness to operate modern, sustainable and ethical businesses. Greenpeace and other Human Rights NGOs are asking them to change the way they operate to meet regulations for the sustainability and viability of the fishing and seafood sectors,” added Pipattanawattanakul.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s supply chain investigations demonstrate the unacceptably high risk of tainted surimi [7] entering numerous seafood and non-seafood supply chains throughout 2016,  including products destined for export which end up being raw ingredients for sushi and pet food products sold around the world.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"As long as transshipment at sea continues, it will be nearly impossible for any seafood company to guarantee that the fish they are selling is both sustainable and ethically caught,” said Oliver Knowles, Sustainable Tuna Project Leader at Greenpeace New Zealand. “The case for banning transshipments at sea grows stronger by the day. The evidence in our report puts more pressure on the Thai and international fishing industry to phase out this deeply problematic practice that allows so many problems to flourish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace is calling for greater control, including prioritising efforts to eliminate risky practices such as transshipment at sea, to be exerted over Thailand’s distant water fishing fleets. It recommends stricter monitoring and enforcement measures from the Thai government to ensure that only sustainably and ethically-produced Thai seafood reaches the shelves, freezers, sushi bars and cat bowls around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 9 February 2016 — Commenting on today’s launch of the ‘RSPO Next’ scheme, Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner Ratri Kusumohartono said ‘Next’s’ optional undertakings fell far short of satisfying mounting demands for a deforestation-free palm oil industry. [1]
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“RSPO’s ‘Next’ scheme is a failed upgrade. RSPO Next won’t halt deforestation nor save peatlands from drainage, yet these are the two biggest environmental problems the palm oil industry faces,” Ratri said in Jakarta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil is struggling to respond to criticism that it fails to provide an answer to continuing forest destruction for palm oil. It seems the RSPO has recognised the urgent need for the sort of commitments made by the Palm Oil Innovation Group (POIG). Sadly, instead of adopting the POIG charter wholesale, it has created a weak new standard and made it purely optional for RSPO membership.” [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The critical issue that the industry-dominated RSPO needs to address is how it defines ‘No Deforestation’. Instead of going with a strong, proven methodology such as the High Carbon Stock Approach [3] it has compromised with a ‘net carbon’ approach. In practice this means that companies can continue to clear forests as long as they compensate for carbon losses with carbon stored in their palm plantations or elsewhere in the concession. This is not what No Deforestation means to Greenpeace, or to other NGOs and company members of the &lt;a href="http://highcarbonstock.org/"&gt;HCS Approach Steering Group&lt;/a&gt;, nor to the traders and consumer companies that have committed to stop buying palm oil linked to deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Years after progressive companies pledged to do so, RSPO now has optional guidelines prohibiting new development on peatlands. However, as Indonesia’s 2015 fire crisis revealed, stopping new peat clearance is not enough to prevent fires from taking hold across the millions of hectares of peatlands already drained for plantations. The only solution is to re-wet and restore peatland landscapes impacted by company operations — but the RSPO Next scheme does not require this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “The RSPO, which should be setting the bar high on environmental standards, is playing catch-up with Indonesian regulations, which not only ban new peat clearance but demand restoration of burnt areas and efforts to re-wet damaged peatlands. However, we are encouraged by the RSPO Next requirement that member companies enforce its guidelines at an organization-wide level, as this encourages greater responsibility across the supply chain,” Ratri said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Notes to Editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;[1] &lt;a href="http://www.rspo.org/news-and-events/announcements/rspo-introduces-advanced-addon-criteria-for-sustainable-palm-oil"&gt;http://www.rspo.org/news-and-events/announcements/rspo-introduces-advanced-addon-criteria-for-sustainable-palm-oil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;[2] Established in 2013, the Palm Oil Innovation Group (&lt;a href="http://poig.org/"&gt;http://poig.org/&lt;/a&gt;) of progressive palm companies – supported by Greenpeace together with other NGOs – has developed a benchmark for socially and environmentally responsible palm oil production, including higher standards for many areas including human rights and labor. Critically, independent third-party verification of standard is a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;[3] The HCS Approach is a methodology that distinguishes forest areas for protection from degraded lands with low carbon and biodiversity values that may be developed. It puts No Deforestation into practice. See &lt;a href="http://highcarbonstock.org/"&gt;http://highcarbonstock.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The widely supported High Carbon Stock Approach [1] is a tool to help companies and other stakeholders implement commitments to end deforestation. It puts No Deforestation into practice on the ground by identifying degraded areas suitable for potential plantation development and forest areas for protection while respecting community rights and livelihoods. The HCS Approach has been developed since 2011 and is adopted by some of the largest companies in the plantation sector, such as APP, Wilmar, Cargill and GAR, consumer companies Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble, as well as leading NGOs, like WWF, RAN, UCS, Greenpeace and Forest Peoples Programme.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In response to this robust and practical methodology, a group of companies - the Sustainable Palm Oil Manifesto group (SPOM) initiated a study into what from their perspective HCS should be. The recent draft report of this SPOM study proposes a methodology that would allow continued clearance of forest for plantation development. The outcomes of the study appear to be in line with the fact that the SPOM group of companies have mostly to date refused to adopt strong policies to halt deforestation throughout their supply chains. So, while progressive parts of industry are actually protecting forests and peatlands, these companies are undermining this practical approach by proposing a weaker methodology with the same name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These palm oil companies are pushing for a business as usual outcome that will allow them to continue to destroy rainforests while selling so-called ‘sustainable palm oil’ to the global market. Given the scale of the climate and biodiversity crisis we face, business as usual is no longer an option,” said Annisa Rahmawati, Forest Campaigner at Greenpeace.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Instead of finding ways to continue deforestation and accelerating climate change, we urge those companies and their customers to support the existing HCS Approach and Steering Group to move forward with one global approach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the SPOM study proposing that will allow more deforestation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The SPOM HCS study as outlined in their ‘draft synergy report’ is focused on balancing carbon emissions rather than on a tool for companies to achieve ‘No Deforestation’ throughout their supply chains. It explicitly says that forests can be converted to palm oil plantations if “(major) local/sub-national benefits arise” (p. 8). This forest clearing can be “balanced” by such actions as “off-setting by additional storage of carbon in forests outside the concession, or the purchase of carbon credits from reputable markets.” (p. 9). The SPOM approach clearly and explicitly allows the clearing of forests that the HCS Approach would protect. Specifically, Young Regenerating Forest (YRF), Low Density Forest and Medium Density Forest can be cleared according to the SPOM study (p. 9), while under the HCS Approach they may not, with the exception of some isolated small patches of YRF that would not be ecologically viable.   The SPOM proposal if adopted would thus be a big step backward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the SPOM study will not protect all forests, the work undertaken by the scientists in the study provides some useful research on the use of new tools for more accurate mapping of forest carbon content, expected emissions from soil carbon, and on required social outcomes from palm oil development including procedures that ensure communities can give or withhold Free, Prior and Informed Consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the HCS Approach?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The HCS Approach builds on the methodology originally developed by Golden Agri Resources, Greenpeace and The Forest Trust from 2011. It allows ‘No Deforestation’ commitments to be put into practice, integrating High Carbon Stock (HCS) forest assessments with High Conservation Value (HCV) assessments, the protection of peatlands, riparian zones, and local community land use and livelihoods. It respects the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities to give or withhold their free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) to proposed developments or conservation that may affect their lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HCS Approach is overseen and governed by a multi-stakeholder body called the HCS Approach Steering Group. The group leads a process for further development and global standardisation of the HCS methodology, including feedback from ongoing trials and implementation, and recommendations from science and research. The Steering Group has published a toolkit on the HCS Approach[2]. Members of the Steering Group include: Agropalma, Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), Golden Agri-Resources (GAR), Musim Mas, Unilever and Wilmar, as well as the NGOs Forest Peoples Programme (FPP), Greenpeace, Rainforest Action Network, Union of Concerned Scientists and WWF, and the technical support organisations The Forest Trust and Rainforest Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

	Bangkok— An art exhibit launched today by Greenpeace, is putting the invisible threats of Thailand’s air pollution in the spotlight.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The exhibit, “Right to Clean Air--The Art Exhibition”, mounted at the Bangkok Art and Culture Center was organised with Thai artist Ruangsak Anuwatwimon. It features installations created out of dust from air pollution gathered from the country’s most polluted provinces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events are part of a series of public activities organised by Greenpeace Southeast Asia to raise public awareness about air pollution, and shed light on the need for urgent solutions to upgrade the country’s Air Quality Index (AQI) by monitoring and regulating air pollution with microscopic dust particles smaller than 2.5 microns. The particles, called PM 2.5, poses serious public health hazards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anuwatwimon, who collaborated with Greenpeace on this art advocacy said: “Thai people currently don't have accurate information of pollution levels in the air they breathe. Through my art, I want to make the invisible visible. The hardest part is to make people realise that there is something toxic in the air they breathe. In some areas, people cannot speak about their own health. If we cannot speak out about our own problems, what else in this country we can do? If our air is polluted, how can we survive? I believe we should have the right to breathe clean air.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art installations “Memory” and “Monolith Souvenir” are made from dust collected from various provinces throughout Thailand. They are displayed at the event to illustrate the impacts of air pollution. “Memory”, a work in paper mache, features life-sized depictions of a child, a mother and an elderly man, in a line. It represents those impacted by air pollution from various sources. “Monolith Souvenir” reflects the impacts of pollution on the environment and the injustice faced by communities victimised by air pollution. These 20 pieces of resin containing leaves and plants contaminated with pollution, acts as a condemnation of the system put in place by polluters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a  World Bank study [1] , Air pollution in Thailand currently causes an estimated 50,000 premature deaths per year. Thailand’s population continues to be exposed to air pollution levels way above standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2017, the levels of air pollution recorded in 19 monitoring stations in 14 cities across Thailand exceed WHO’s safety limits [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two most critical cities with the highest one-year average concentrations of PM 2.5 were Saraburi (36 µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and Thonburi, Bangkok (31 µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), both recorded pollution levels over three times higher than WHO limits. Other cities at risk include Samut Sakhon, Ratchaburi, Khon Kaen, and Chiang Mai, which showed alarming readings between 25-30µg/m.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; All 14 cities monitored exceeded WHO limits. Moreover, nine out of the 14 cities exceeded the national standard’s annual air pollution safety limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The impacts of particulate pollution, specifically PM 2.5, on public health is unseen and ignored by many, including the government,” said Chariya Senpong, Climate and Energy Campaigner, Greenpeace Southeast Asia. “Greenpeace is calling upon the Pollution Control Department to impose stricter standards on particulate matter in the country’s Air Quality Index. Greenpeace is asking the agency to monitor and enforce preventive measures on PM 2.5 in order to protect public health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People should not have to risk their health and wait for years and years for the government to act and seriously improve air quality to save the lives of tens of thousands of Thai citizens,” Senpong added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right to Clean Air - The Art Exhibition” is taking place from 16 to 28 January 2018, at the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; floor of Bangkok Art and Culture Centre (BACC). Aside from the main exhibition, there are forums and talks by experts, on air pollution and its solutions. Other side events include a photo exhibit on air pollution. All activities are open to the public. For more details and for the daily schedule, please visit www.greenpeace.or.th.&lt;/p&gt;

	Kuala Lumpur- Malaysia is the new dumping site for plastic ‘recycling’ from more than 19 countries, including the US, UK and Australia, according to new research released today by Greenpeace Malaysia. “The Recycling Myth” report has uncovered blatant regulation violations in the disposal of this waste, including dumping and open-air burning, and illegal practises contributing to environmental pollution and harmful health impacts for Malaysians.[1]

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Malaysian plastic recycling industry is overwhelmed by the influx and cannot accommodate the waste in a way that is sustainable and acceptable by the government’s own standards. Our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;investigation found evidence of harmful plastic waste processing being carried out in Klang, on the western outskirts of the capital Kuala Lumpur, and Jenjarom to the south,” said Heng Kiah Chun, Public Engagement Campaigner at Greenpeace Malaysia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since China banned plastic waste imports in January 2018, countries in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Southeast Asia - particularly Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia - have accepted an increased amount of plastic waste.[2] B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;etween January and July 2018 alone, Malaysia imported 754,000 metric tonnes of plastic -- the weight of approximately 100,000 large elephants. It came from countries like the United States, Japan, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Finland, France, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite the Malaysian government's crackdown on illegal sites earlier this year including including shutting down 114 of these so-called “plastic waste recycling facilities”, Greenpeace Malaysia’s investigation reveal that many of these facilities still contain huge volumes of imported plastic waste. The plastic is burned on roadsides in the open-air, dumped in unregulated or poorly regulated dump sites close to bodies of water, discarded in abandoned buildings or just left to degrade and rot in the open.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Burning plastic waste poses a significant health risk to nearby communities, with some residents already complaining of respiratory illnesses allegedly caused by the haze and pollution coming from open air burning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The decision of the Malaysian government to permanently ban the import of plastic waste last month is a strong step in the right direction. However, to stem the deluge of imported waste the ban needs to expand beyond solid waste that cannot be properly recycled and does not follow the Environmental Quality Act,[3] closing the door for so-called ’quality, clean plastic’ waste,” Heng added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ninety percent of waste is exported from high-income countries and then all too often either openly burned or dumped in low-income countries. Globally, only 9% of plastic waste is actually recycled, 12% is incinerated, and the remaining 79% ends up in landfill or the natural environment. [4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The problem is not only a Malaysian problem.The international waste trade system itself is broken and based on false assumptions about what really happens with waste. All countries should put in place policies to reduce the use of single-use plastics to a point where waste export,  landfill or incineration is unnecessary. Malaysia and other developing countries should not be the dumping ground for plastic waste that other countries should be dealing with themselves,” Heng concluded. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ENDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Manila, Philippines  – Nestlé and Unilever are responsible for a quarter of the branded throwaway plastic driving the plastic pollution crisis in the Philippines, according to a report published today by the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (GAIA).
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The companies were named the top polluters based on a series of brand and waste audits conducted in six cities and one province in the country. The report, conducted in collaboration with the University of Santo Tomas’ Research Center for Social Sciences and Education (RCSSEd), provides new evidence exposing Nestlé and Unilever’s overproduction of single-use sachets (small packets containing single-use quantities of any material) that are marketed in the Global South, but not other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the GAIA report’s findings, Greenpeace Southeast Asia (Philippines) Campaigner Abigail Aguilar said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once again, this report suggests that although countries in Southeast Asia are being blamed for the plastic pollution crisis, the responsibility lies with multinational corporations like Nestlé and Unilever that continue to expand their production of unnecessary throwaway plastic at the expense of our communities, waterways, and health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nestlé and Unilever need to stop deflecting the blame for plastic pollution onto individuals. These companies are responsible for this crisis and the only solution is for them to significantly reduce the production of throwaway plastics and move toward refill and reuse systems for their customers throughout the world. It’s time to reject overconsumption and the corporations that continue to sell it to us.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	A briefer on Greenpeace Indonesia’s initiative to support transparency and the public interest through the Kepo Hutan map platform. Includes a case study: 
'Getting Tohor on the map'. 
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p class="BODY"&gt;Sungai Tohor village is situated on one of the Meranti islands off the coast of Riau. In 2014, the village drew international attention after a community member, Pak Manan, started an online petition calling on President Jokowi to come see for himself the terrible impact of fires on his community resulting from peatland drainage by a pulpwood plantation company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="BODY"&gt;In 2009, villagers discovered that more than 10,000 ha of their island had been allocated to a pulpwood company, with 10-metre-wide transport canals cutting through their peatlands and excavators clearing an area of land they use for cultivation. The community also learnt that a 21,000 hectare selective logging concession on the island had been relicensed as a sago plantation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="BODY"&gt;Not only did the community have no say over these allocations, they were not even told, despite these concessions overlapping with their own [unmapped] lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="BODY"&gt;The impact was terrible. Drainage for plantations eventually led to fires in 2014 which burnt some 5,000 hectares of land including community sago orchards. Even without fires, the drainage was damaging natural forest and community sago plantations. According to the community, the drained peatland reaches up to 9 metres in depth – areas which legally are supposed to be off-limits to any such development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="BODY"&gt;In November 2014, as a result of Pak Manan’s online petition, President Jokowi visited the village to see for himself the cause of the community’s concerns. Moved by what he saw, the president personally helped the community construct a dam across the drained peatlands. He ordered his ministers to revoke the plantation licence and review all industrial concessions on peatland to see whether they were damaging ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="BODY"&gt;A year and a half later, the people of Sungai Tohor have been told that the pulpwood concession has been revoked, but are still unsure of the legal status of their own sustainable sago plantations, and of the boundaries of the industrial sago plantation concession which remains. The villagers have been given no official letters or maps to clarify the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="BODY"&gt;Maps such as those contained in Greenpeace’s Kepo Hutan platform, seen in use below by Pak Manan at Sungai Tohor in March 2016, could help provide communities with the certainty that inspires both entrepreneurship and good stewardship. Ultimately however it is up to the government to ensure the latest and most complete information is available to the public. &lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 23 April 2018. For almost two months sailing from east of Indonesia, Greenpeace legendary ship,the Rainbow Warrior, has finally set the anchor in Indonesia capital city, Jakarta. Before the Jakarta visit, the ship sailed to campaign for the forest and  ocean in Papua and also anchored in Bali to discuss Renewable Energy issues, protesting Benoa Bay reclamation and plastic waste.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rainbow Warrior drops its anchor in Jakarta with the mission to support renewable energy for Jakarta’s clean air. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of the Rainbow Warrior in Jakarta with the mission to encourage the Indonesia government to tackle the urban environmental issues in their entirety. The acknowledgement of massive environmental issues from air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Indonesian high dependencies on fossil fuels such as: oil, gas and coal, have worsened the level of air pollution in the capital of the nation. ‘As the centre of the government and the capital city of Indonesia, Jakarta should be the example of for other regions or cities in our country to combat climate change, by shifting to renewable energy,’ said Hindun Malaika, Greenpeace Indonesia Climate and Energy Campaigner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jakarta’s problem with its pollution requires policies and calculated strategies and solutions. The approach should start with increasing and strengthening the standard of air quality, a periodic air quality control and set up the target for reducing the source of the pollution. Within transportation sector, the priority should be on increasing mass transportation with electricity as the source.’ Hindun added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Numerous countries in the world have shifted into the usage of the renewable energy. More than 100 cities all over the world have utilised renewable energy as their source of power at the minimum of 70%. It has been seen as a monumental movement with more than 7,400 mayors globally having decided to fight the climate change by improving their policies in the energy sector.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace wishes there will be a collaboration between government and Jakarta citizens to move to renewable energy. The use of rooftop solar panels is the most effective renewable energy for densely populated urban areas such as Jakarta.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the movement becomes significant for the Jakarta people, Jakarta will generate opportunities for several strands of  profit. The benefits, for example, increased number of industries, businesses and investments in this sector that will create green job market opportunities and also boost economic growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;‘This programme certainly requires financial support starts from the government in provinces, and banking sector will support its financing.’ Hindun said. ‘Rooftop solar panel development will be the contribution from individual or family to fight the climate change and abolish pollution from our air.’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Bangkok, 22 February 2018 - Greenpeace activists today presented an hourglass filled with dust from areas in Bangkok and other provinces most affected by the severe air pollution to a representative of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha at the Office of the Civil Service Commission.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;According to activists, the hourglass symbolizes calls on the government to urgently tackle the air pollution crisis caused by fine particulates less than 2.5 micron (PM2.5) from transportation, open burning, electricity generation and manufacturing. They also submitted an open letter to the government [1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bangkok cannot continue choking on hazardous air. It endangers the lives of people, affects&lt;br&gt;economic productivity and negatively impacts the prestige of one of the most popular cities on earth,” said Tara Buakamsri, Thailand Country Director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia. “The Prime Minister, who is also the chairperson of the National Environment board, should order the Pollution Control Department to upgrade the country’s air quality index and immediately implement proper air-quality warning systems to protect people&amp;amp;#39;s health.”&lt;br&gt;Since 2015, Greenpeace compiled a ranking for PM2.5 in Thailand, which consistently indicated that air quality in urban areas have deteriorated over the years. Bangkok and urban areas showed elevated levels of PM2.5, exceeding the safety limits set by Thailand and the World Health Organization. It also one of the key sustainable development goals where Thailand has failed, nor is there a target to cope with the current crisis. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangkok has suffered the worst air pollution in its history, of 52 days between 1st January 2018 to 21 February 2018, there were 40 days in which the level of PM2.5 exceeding the World Health Organization's 24 hour safety limits in some areas. [3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the open letter to Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o- cha, Greenpeace emphasized that in order for the government to reach its 20-year vision of “Safe Air for All” it needs to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the standard of PM2.5 and mercury at its source, including measurement and reporting of PM 2.5 and mercury emissions from smoke stacks of fossil fuel power plants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the reduction target for PM2.5 in ambient air at 30% by 2036 under its 20 year strategic plan for air quality management in Thailand to reduce exposure from dangerous air pollutants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set as a key indicator the reduction of premature deaths from dangerous air pollutants including PM2.5 in its 20-year strategic air quality management plan in Thailand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor and report the concentration of PM 2.5 and other air pollutants such as Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) that threaten people health. Make this information public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take into account the implementation of Article 8 under Minamata Convention on mercury controls and, where feasible, reduce emissions of mercury and mercury compounds in the atmosphere from point sources including existing coal-fired power plants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	During New York Climate Summit, Incoming President Urged to Extend Moratorium, Protect Peatlands
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Four leading companies in the palm oil industry have today launched a pledge to protect forests and carbon-rich peatlands during the New York Climate Summit. As these companies already have individual No Deforestation policies, the breakthrough of this initiative is the involvement of KADIN, the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesian industry bodies have long fought against protecting forests from ever-expanding plantations. Now, following the growing demand for deforestation-free palm oil, KADIN has seen the benefit of lobbying for a level playing field to reward leading companies. Greenpeace welcomes this initiative and is looking forward together with KADIN to push an ambitious policy agenda to protect Indonesia’s remaining forests and peatlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With this advance, industry leaves President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono lagging behind in terms of policies to protect Indonesian forests,” said Greenpeace Indonesia’s Bustar Maitar. “The onus is now on President SBY during his last weeks in office to take a courageous step to secure his environmental legacy. He can do that by revising the flawed peatlands regulation. The regulation does not deal with existing concessions, and will not provide protection on the scale necessary to halt the greenhouse gas emissions juggernaut that is set in motion when peatlands are drained for plantations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events in New York this week are also turning attention to a burning issue which presents a challenge for incoming president-elect Joko “Jokowi” Widodo. In his first 6 months in office Jokowi faces a decision on the future of a moratorium, put in place by his predecessor, on the allocation of new permits in primary forests and peatlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace urges Jokowi to heed the clear signal from leading plantation companies to not only extend but strengthen the moratorium to cover all High Carbon Stock [1] areas identified for protection in existing concessions,” said Bustar. “A legal review of these concessions and the publication of the national One Map land use plan will also be necessary to enable relocation of concessions to low carbon land. The One Map will also provide the guidance needed to ensure good forest governance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the new pledge’s signatory companies, Wilmar, GAR and Cargill, are taking steps to ensure that their operations and supply chains no longer contribute to deforestation, peatlands destruction and social conflict. These companies use the High Carbon Stock Approach for the implementation of their commitments, and participate in the HCS Steering Group that was launched last month in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth signatory of the pledge however, is part of the RGE Group of companies which are continuing to destroy Indonesian forests for new plantations. While RGE Group’s oil palm plantation company Asian Agri is joining the Pledge and has announced new sustainability policies, the Sukanto Tanoto-owned RGE Group also owns notorious pulp-and paper companies APRIL and Toba Pulp Lestari. On Padang Island, Sumatra, bulldozers are right this moment continuing to clear forests in deep peatlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace welcomes the commitment by another big Indonesian palm oil company to stop clearing forests and peat lands, but we regret that the Sukanto Tanoto’s RGE Group has failed to seize this opportunity to address all of the group’s impacts on the rainforests of Indonesia and to commit to support wider forest conservation initiatives,” said Bustar. “If Mr Tanoto was serious about forest protection he would be stopping the bulldozers immediately in Indonesia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace calls on RGE to immediately implement No Deforestation commitments that apply to all pulp and palm oil businesses that are owned or controlled by the Tanoto family, and to support conservation initiatives on a scale that matches the group’s previous responsibility for deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;

	“Integration should not come at the price of environmental ruin and human rights,” ASEAN youths stated today at the eve of the opening of the 21st Summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The youth are urging their leaders to protect the rights of the people and the environment as the region pursues a single economic community in an era of runaway climate change.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Following a local religious tradition, activists from the Khmer Youth Association, the People Center for Development and Peace and Greenpeace chanted prayers at the Independence Monument (Vimean Ekareach) in the capital. The activists also carried banners that said “Environmental Rights = Human Rights.”&lt;br&gt; “Southeast Asia is now among the fastest growing regions in the world. But its development should not come at the price of human rights. We want our leaders to remember that environmental rights—the right to clean water, air and a healthy environment—are human rights too,” said Yong Kim Eng, president of the People Center for Development and Peace (PCDP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At present, Cambodia is losing most of its forests from mining and logging industries. Deforestation in Southeast Asia is also fastest among forest regions of the world. While these activities are localized, their impacts are beyond national boundaries.  Because of this, we recommend that ASEAN use climate-friendly standards and trans-boundary impact assessment in economic community building,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The same standards should apply in meeting the increasing energy demand in Cambodia and Southeast Asia. What will save our climate and what will save Southeast Asia? One of the answers is to end the era of carbon intensive dirty coal. As youths, we pray that the leaders of our region will ensure our bright future with solar, wind and other clean and renewable sources of energy,” said Chamroeun Mak, President of the Khmer Youth Association (KYA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ASEAN is set to review its implementation of the plan to integrate the ten member countries into a single giant market. Set to be achieved in 2015, the plan involves building bridges, roads, power plants, and internet facilities to connect the ten countries; observe a single visa within the region; foster more cultural and educational exchange; and intensify intra-regional business and activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ten ASEAN leaders are also expected to sign and ratify the ASEAN Declaration of Human Rights, the  framework of the ASEAN Inter-governmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR).  Early drafts of the declaration have been met with strong criticism from civil society groups, as it falls short of the requirements of the United Nations. But its deficiencies should not be used as an excuse not to act upon petitions that seek to uphold the environmental rights of ASEAN citizens in the process of economic community building. KYA, PDCP and Greenpeace are asking ASEAN heads to direct the AICHR to set the standards of environmental rights in accordance to the UN’s ‘protect, respect, and remedy’ framework.(1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some studies show that without safeguards, ASEAN’s economic community building would degrade the environment, contribute to the causes, and risks from the impacts, of the climate crisis. With current trends it is predicted that by 2030 ASEAN’s share of global energy-related carbon-dioxide emissions will reach 5%, up from the current 3.5%, according to the Institute of Energy Economics of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the attendance of newly elected US President Barrack Obama at the Summit, ASEAN leaders must use this opportunity to call on the US to join the EU in raising ambition for climate action and deliver adequate and predictable climate finance for vulnerable countries such as most ASEAN states,” said Zelda Soriano, Political Advisor of Greenpeace Southeast Asia. “Unless urgently addressed, climate change will inflict further suffering on the region’s poor and hinder the ASEAN’s grand plans to become an integrated economic community.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Under the ‘State Duty to Protect,’ ASEAN governments should promote common policies, laws and rules for business in relation to human rights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the ‘Corporate Responsibility to Respect’ principles, ASEAN must provide common blueprints for companies on how to know and show that they are respecting human rights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ‘Access to Remedy’ principles focus on ensuring that where people are harmed by business activities, there should be both adequate accountability and effective redress, judicial and non-judicial, in ASEAN countries.&lt;/li&gt;

	Singapore: Major plantation companies and NGOs including Golden Agri-Resources, Asia Pulp and Paper, Wilmar International Limited, Greenpeace, Agropalma, WWF, the Forest Peoples Programme, Rainforest Action Network, Unilever and TFT have today endorsed the publication of the first version of a Toolkit which will give commodity-producing companies worldwide practical guidance on how to identify tropical forests for conservation and degraded lands for potential plantation development.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The HCS Approach was developed to help companies implement their commitments to end deforestation in their supply chains. The Toolkit provides guidance for producers on how to identify High Carbon Stock (HCS) forests and integrate them with other land use planning approaches such as High Conservation Value areas, the protection of peatlands, and respect for the rights of indigenous and traditional communities to their lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Toolkit has been developed by members of the HCS Approach Steering Group, a group of leading plantation companies with commitments to eliminate deforestation, NGOs and technical support organisations. Established in Singapore in 2014, the Steering Group is working to oversee the governance and standardisation of the HCS Approach to achieve a halt to deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the launch of the toolkit, Grant Rosoman, Forest Solutions Coordinator at Greenpeace, said: “The HCS Approach breaks new ground by providing a practical way to achieve No Deforestation together with recognition of community land rights. The publication of this Toolkit should enable the widespread adoption of the HCS Approach in key tropical forest regions where oil palm and pulp and paper plantations are being developed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Heng, Managing Director of Communications and Sustainability at Golden Agri-Resources and member of the Steering Group said: “Golden Agri-Resources pioneered the HCS approach in collaboration with The Forest Trust and Greenpeace when we announced our Forest Conservation Policy in early 2011, which focuses on No Deforestation. As a leading player in the palm oil industry, we worked with multi-stakeholders to develop the HCS Approach that is tested and acknowledged. We look forward to the support from multiple players including governments, communities, producers, consumer companies and NGOs to achieve success in HCS forest conservation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It's absolutely brilliant for me to see this toolkit in all its colour,” said Scott Poynton, CEO of TFT. “I remember our very first discussion about HCS between TFT, GAR and Greenpeace way back in November 2010. Since then, tens of thousands of trees have been measured in lands as diverse as Indonesia, Liberia and Papua New Guinea, satellite data has been pored over, ground checks have followed and forests have been set aside and we have spoken with communities, NGOs, scientists, other experts and governments. This toolkit distils the knowledge we have developed together to date and sets a great platform to expand the application and expansion of that learning to a more global audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aida Greenbury, Managing Director for Sustainability at Asia Pulp and Paper and also member of the Steering Group said: “As the industry moves towards Zero Deforestation, it is vital that we have an agreed method for defining what forest is. We hope that the development of the HCS Approach will form the foundation for forest conservation over years to come and we invite Government, industry and other stakeholders to follow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marcus Colchester, Senior Policy Advisor at the Forest Peoples Programme, said that “the HCS Approach is also about people. As major players in the palm oil and pulp industries seek to implement their new commitments, this tool, properly used, holds the potential to protect forests as well as secure the land rights and livelihoods of indigenous peoples and local communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Goon, Wilmar’s Chief Sustainability Officer, said: “Removing deforestation from commodity supply chains has gained momentum in the past two years with many major resource-based companies now sharing the same commitment. Along with established conservation approaches like High Conservation Value (HCV) areas, the High Carbon Stock (HCS) framework is a cornerstone for sustainable plantation development. We now look forward to transitioning the framework from concept to field implementation through a defined Toolkit. Wilmar’s No Deforestation commitment covers its entire supply chain, including its third-party suppliers; our next step is to work with key actors in the palm oil industry, including with the relevant government authorities and our suppliers towards equitable solutions to forest preservation and socio-economic development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The HCS Toolkit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Toolkit will enable experienced practitioners to undertake their own HCS assessments, integrate them with HCV and FPIC considerations and create an integrated land use plan for a plantation concession in a forested area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been tested in pilot palm oil and pulp and paper concessions in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Liberia and is expected to be widely adopted by companies in other countries and products in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toolkit includes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Background on the methodology and the HCS Approach Steering Group &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapters 2 – 6:&lt;/strong&gt; Practitioner guidance on how to undertake and integrate HCS assessments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter 7:&lt;/strong&gt; Conclusions and areas for further study &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HCS Approach was first developed by Golden Agri Resources, TFT and Greenpeace in 2011. Since then, it has been adopted by other major producers including Asia Pulp and Paper and Wilmar, who both announced No Deforestation policies in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach has attracted support from global consumer companies, including Unilever, Neste Oil, Ferrero, Mars and Nestlé, as part of a suite of actions to deliver on their commitments to prevent further deforestation in the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with the publication of the toolkit, the HCS Approach Steering Group is opening a consultation period on the methodology through participation in the HCS Consultative Forum. The Forum will be open to parties with an interest in the approach including plantation companies, manufacturers, retailers, financial institutions as well as industry bodies, academia and civil society groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback can be provided via the Consultative Forum of the HCS Approach:  http://highcarbonstock.org/consultative-forum/. Further editions of the HCS Toolkit will include revisions based on stakeholder feedback as well as recommendations from further field trials and new scientific information.&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, June 5, 2012 - Greenpeace Indonesia welcomed the release today of a report from palm oil producer Golden Agri-Resources (GAR) identifying which forests should be protected as an important step forward in the fight against deforestation.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The High Carbon Stock (HCS) report, part of GAR’s Forest Conservation Policy, was launched at a workshop hosted by the Indonesia government’s REDD Task Force in Jakarta. The Task Force is working to fulfill President Yudhoyono’s commitment to reduce emissions by 26%, or 41% with international help, by 2020. (1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Golden Agri-Resources is providing a clear industry example that it is possible for a company to identify which forests should be set aside for conservation. This represents a critical milestone in the fight to end deforestation for palm oil,” said Bustar Maitar, head of Greenpeace Indonesia’s forest campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2011 Greenpeace acknowledged GAR’s commitment to eliminate deforestation from all of its operations and move to a zero deforestation footprint (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, GAR has been collaborating with The Forest Trust (TFT), a global non-profit organisation working to deliver responsible products, and Greenpeace, to design a set of strong standards for the identification of forest conservation areas. This effort resulted in the first study of its kind aiming to develop a practical, scientifically robust and cost effective methodology to define and identify areas of High Carbon Stock forests for conservation. This included a provisional threshold for HCS of greater than 35 tonnes of carbon per hectare. (3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This development can significantly help the Indonesian government fulfill its commitment to reduce the country’s greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation, through being able to identify forests areas to be conserved and low-carbon degraded forests which may be developed. It will be critical for the government of Indonesia to fully support GAR’s efforts by facilitating a framework to enable carbon stock and forest conservation, reviewing, and amending regulations if necessary, and insisting on similar requirements across all industries operating in forest areas,” said Maitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has waged a three-year campaign to stop deforestation for palm oil. GAR’s commitment today clearly shows that industry and civil society can work together to implement solutions to safeguard the environment and the livelihoods of dependent communities, at the same time as ensuring continued economic growth. Indonesia’s government, for its part, should redouble its efforts to improve forest governance and strengthen its enforcement of existing forestry laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GAR’s sister company, Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), which is responsible for widespread deforestation to source paper and packaging products, should follow GAR’s initiative and finally get serious about eliminating deforestation from its supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace will continue to monitor the implementation of GAR’s global Forest Conservation Policy and urges the rest of the industry to follow GAR's lead. Palm oil and other forest use sectors, such as pulp and paper, need to create and apply global standards to ensure that deforestation has been eliminated from its supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) As part of its FCP implementation, GAR set a provisional carbon threshold to not develop land that contains over 35 tonnes of carbon per hectare of above ground biomass (AGB). This figure is now supported by the results of the HCS forests study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that six strata of vegetation cover could be identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vegetation cover definitions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High Density Forest (HK3) – Remnant forest or advanced secondary forest close to primary condition. Average 192 tC/ha;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium Density Forest (HK2) – Remnant forest but more disturbed than High Density Forest. Average 166 tC/ha;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low Density Forest (HK1) – Appears to be remnant forest but highly disturbed and recovering (may contain plantation/mixed garden). Average 107 tC/ha;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old Scrub (BT) – Mostly young re-growth forest, but with occasional patches of older forest within the stratum. Average 60 tC/ha;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young Scrub (BM) – Recently cleared areas, some woody regrowth and grass-like ground cover. Average 27 tC/ha;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleared/Open Land (LT) – Very recently cleared land with mostly grass or crops, few woody plants. Average 17 tC/ha;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study supports the provisional 35tC/ha HCS threshold falling between vegetation strata BT (Old scrub, regenerating forest) and BM (recently degraded or cleared areas), and this draws a very neat threshold for what is forest and what is so degraded that it is not, and that the lower carbon classes of HCS forest include a potential for regeneration of carbon stock.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contacts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	(Joint Press Statement) Jakarta, Indonesia - Today, the Palm Oil Innovation Group (POIG), a leading initiative to transform the palm oil industry, has released a new, robust and field-tested set of verification indicators that will drive much-needed change in the industry. The POIG Charter is already being used by leaders in the palm oil sector to break the link between palm oil, the destruction of forests and peatlands, and the violation of human and labour rights. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The POIG verification indicators will be used by independent third parties to determine if a palm oil company is protecting forests and peatlands that have high biodiversity, carbon and social values, while simultaneously upholding the rights of local communities and workers, and improving livelihoods for local communities. The indicators have been field tested by three palm oil growers who are founding members of the POIG, in Brazil, Colombia and Papua New Guinea, and it will soon be put into practice in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “We have shown that it is possible to grow palm oil responsibly and that our claims can be tested and verified in the field by independent third-parties in a cost-effective manner. This is important as consumers want to know that the ingredients in the products they use have been grown to the highest environmental and social standards possible,” said Tulio Dias Brito, Agropalma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “Today marks a leap forward in our efforts to transform the palm oil sector. We have developed the first field-tested verification tool that can be used by global brands to third-party verify their suppliers’ compliance with the Palm Oil Innovation Group Charter,” said Annisa Rahmawati, Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “The Palm Oil Innovation Group (POIG) remains the gold standard for the production of responsible palm oil. It builds upon other certification systems, such as the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil, and tackles some of the most challenging issues facing the palm oil sector, such as the destruction of high carbon stock forests and the abuse of the most vulnerable workers,” said Matthias Diemer, Chair of the Palm Oil Innovation Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “The time has come for other palm oil producers, traders, retailers and manufacturers to demand, and scale up their efforts to produce truly responsible palm oil that is in line with the leading POIG Charter,” concluded Robin Averbeck, Rainforest Action Network. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Palm Oil Innovation Group (POIG) is a collective of progressive palm oil companies and brands together with environmental and social NGOs that are working to build on the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil standards and commitments by both demonstrating innovation to implement RSPO existing standards as well as additional critical issues. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more information visit &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.poig.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;www.poig.org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 18 February 2016 -- Indonesia’s second-largest palm oil grower PT Astra Agro Lestari  this week added its signature to the Indonesia Palm Oil Pledge, showing that industry commitment to No Deforestation continues to grow. [1]
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner Annisa Rahmawati said:&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;“Greenpeace is pleased to see Astra Agro join the Indonesia Palm Oil Pledge. We hope its director will use his chairmanship of the Indonesian Palm Oil Association (GAPKI) to set a constructive 2016 agenda for the whole industry to work to protect forests and peatlands to prevent a repeat of last year’s fires crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This goal is entirely achievable, and in keeping with President Joko Widodo’s commitments on forest and peat protection and fire prevention. The President’s vision emphasises the importance of transparency, through the One Map initiative. Greenpeace therefore urges all companies to support transparency by publishing map data for their own concessions and their third party suppliers, to enable monitoring and protection of forests and peatlands. We note the RSPO is already moving in this direction, with member concession maps due for release in the next quarter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the space of just a few months in late 2015, fires raged across Indonesian forests, peatlands and plantations, a crisis which the World Bank estimates cost the country’s economy $16 billion, or almost 2% of GDP. [2] The human cost of the crisis was even greater, with countless people across the region suffering from both acute and chronic impacts of breathing a toxic haze of smoke particles and gases. In Indonesia alone, Ministry of Health data showed at least 120,000 people sought medical help because of the fires. [3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some large players in Indonesia are hiding behind concern for smallholders and economic figures as an excuse to avoid ending the large scale deforestation and peat drainage which led to last year’s fire crisis. In fact, The companies in IPOP that have made the No Deforestation pledge have also committed to work with smallholders to enhance their productivity. If these pledges are implemented, it will enable smallholders to profit from the global market demand for responsible palm oil, and strengthen the competitiveness of Indonesian palm oil in the global market,” Annisa said.&lt;/p&gt;

	Musim Mas, one of Indonesia’s biggest traders in palm oil, has announced that it has joined the Indonesian Palm Oil Pledge. The IPOP signatories are a number of progressive Indonesian palm oil companies that have announced the right steps to stop deforestation in their own concessions and supply chains. Together with the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce, they are urging the government to introduce strong measures to ensure forest and peatland protection.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Greenpeace welcomes Musim Mas’ decision to join IPOP, and hopes that the IPOP signatory companies will combine to voice a strong call for conservation to the Indonesian government. Earlier this week a government representative claimed that “our primary customers are not concerned about deforestation’’. [1] The fact is that now, the five biggest traders have policies to only source palm oil that is free from links to deforestation and peatland destruction. This shows that there is an economic opportunity for Indonesia to lead in fulfilling global market demands for responsible palm oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While the private sector is moving forward with forest and peatland protection however, the forest moratorium is due to expire in under two months, and it is still unclear what steps President Joko Widodo is planning to take to strengthen the currently inadequate regulatory regime. Annisa Rahmawati, Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “It is critical that the president not only extends the current forest moratorium that has been in place since 2011, but strengthens it by opening a public space for participation, publishing the “one map” and adding protection for all natural forests and peatlands, in both new and existing concessions. The Indonesian government also needs to appreciate the increasing trend to zero deforestation on both supply and demand sides by enshrining positive moves by the private sector into strong national policies and regulations. Only by reforming regulations and undertaking the promised concession review can the president ensure the long-term protection of forests and peatlands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step for IPOP signatories like Musim Mas is to take necessary measures to put their ambitious commitments into practice. These companies need to ensure there is no link to forest clearance and peatlands in their supply chains and work closely with suppliers to comply with their commitments. Musim Mas is also in the process of applying for membership to the Palm Oil Innovation Group,[2] which means it will commit to independent third-party verification of its compliance with the POIG charter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In addition, Musim Mas is to be commended for becoming a member of the High Carbon Stock Approach Steering Group. HCS puts ‘’No Deforestation” into practice, ensuring there is a practical, transparent, and scientifically credible approach that is widely accepted to implement commitments to halt deforestation in the tropics, while ensuring that the rights, livelihoods and aspirations of local peoples are respected.

	Rokan Hilir: Greenpeace today launched its “Save Tigers’ Home” Tour in Sumatra with a cultural blessing ceremony from local community. The goal of the month-long tour is to highlight the ongoing destruction of Sumatra’s last remaining forests and to mobilise the public to help stop this rampant deforestation. Sumatra’s last remaining forests are the key habitat for the critically endangered Sumatra tiger.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Local community leaders in Jumrah Village, Rokan Hilir, Riau Province, blessed five tiger-suited Greenpeace activists who are touring Sumatra on motorbikes, with a ‘Tepung Tawar’ ceremony to ward off evil spirits during the tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Now Sumatra tigers often wander in to our village and we are frightened, there have been several recent casualties. The tigers come to our village because their home, the  forest, is being destroyed by pulp and paper companies. We hope this Greenpeace Tour can convey our problems to  the authorities, and especially the land tenure conflict we are dealing now,”&lt;/strong&gt; said Jumrah Chief Leader, Sukardi Ahmad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&lt;strong&gt; ‘Save Tiger’s Home’ &lt;/strong&gt;Tour was soft launched in Jakarta on 16th September 2011, with a ‘Silat Harimau’ martial art show, photo exhibition and speeches by prominent figures from Indonesian civil society, urging Government to review existing concessions, protect peatland and the forestry sector to implement a zero deforestation policy in their operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On this tour, Greenpeace activists will bear witness to the forest destruction to show the public the scale of the problem and what is at stake if it is not stopped. We are asking all people to help us monitor the destruction and join us to save Indonesia’s rainforests by becoming a ’Tiger Eye’ (1)”, said Rusmadya Maharuddin, Greenpeace Southeast Asia Forests Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sumatran tiger’s forest habitat is being destroyed, with only around 400 Sumatran tigers left in the wild. The Indonesian government estimates that more than one million hectares of forest are being cleared every year. With the current rates of forest destruction, this magnificent animal that has inspired Indonesia’s rich culture, is likely to follow its predecessors, the Javanese and Bali tiger, into extinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Protecting Indonesia’s remaining forests from companies like Asia Pulp &amp;amp; Paper is more important than ever before. Companies must stop their destructive practices, while the Government must review all existing concessions and protect peatland,” concluded Zulfahmi, Greenpeace Southeast Asia Forests Team Leader.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace last night lit up the ancient temple of Borobudur on the outskirts of Yogyakarta--a UNESCO World Heritage site--using only renewable energy.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 3px 5px;" src="/seasia/PageFiles/461227/climaterescue.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"&gt;Greenpeace sees the “Solarizing Borobodur” event  as a ‘moment of  enlightenment,’ which symbolizes that Indonesia can achieve a cleaner  and safer energy future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sri Puryono, Central Java Governor  Assistant on behalf of  Bibit Waluyo, Central Java Governor, and Dawn  Gosling of Greenpeace Southeast Asia, did the honours at the closing  ceremony, pushing the ‘Energy Revolution’ button that lit up solar  panels installed around Borobudur temple and the Climate Rescue Station.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“This is how the NGO and civil society should work: real action. We  really appreciate what Greenpeace is doing, because we share the same  goal and vision, that renewable energy usage is really important. The  government is  planning to maximize renewable energy use in Central  Java,” said Bibit Waluyo.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“When we look back in years to come we will remember that it was  this symbolic action that inspired Indonesia to reduce its dependence on  coal and other dangerous fossil fuels and embrace an energy revolution,  giving people across the country access to clean, safe energy,” said  Dawn Gosling, Greenpeace Southeast Asia Chief Operating Officer.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“We take this project as our inspiration to work towards a cleaner,  greener and safer future powered by renewable energy which comes from  nature such as the wind, the sun and geothermal energy which meet  environmental sustainability standards. May today be the enlightenment  of Indonesia’s renewable energy future to end the age or era of coal. We  must move forward to the Energy [R]evolution now,” she added.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Indonesia is one of Southeast Asia's fastest  growing economies and  will need massive power generation in the future to meet the increasing  energy demands of its population and industry. Unfortunately, Indonesia  is still heavily dependent on fossil fuels, particularly coal. Coal-  fired power plants are the biggest source of man-made carbon emissions,  and the single biggest cause of climate change.  Coal also causes  irreparable damage to the environment, livelihoods and health of the  Indonesian people.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Due to Indonesia’s geography, the national electricity grid is quite  fragmented, leaving one-third of its population without electricity.   Currently, diesel generators--which are expensive and dependent on  continuous fuel supply--are the only source of power for communities in  remote areas.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Decentralized, off-grid, small-scale RE plants would allow local  people to gain access to clean electricity and help them move away from  expensive diesel or gas,” Hindun Mulaika, Greenpeace Climate and  Renewable Energy campaigner added.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes to editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Climate Rescue Station is a  four-storey tall spherical structure used as a mobile museum to generate  awareness about renewable energy solutions to combat climate change.   It has been used around the world as a platform to tell the world that  ordinary people can do something to stop climate change--but only if  governments opt for a massive uptake of renewable energy (RE).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It was first launched in Poland in 2008, on the edge of one of the  biggest open cast mines in Europe to expose how coal destroys community  health and livelihoods.  The structure has travelled the world to draw  public attention to urgent issues around climate change and solutions.   The structure’s electrical systems are powered by wind and solar  energy.  It is in Indonesia to demonstrate how easy it really is to  shift to renewables, and how fast renewable systems can be deployed.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Join our energy [R]evolution by signing up at  &lt;a href="http://www.berani.greenpeace.or.id/" target="_blank"&gt;www.berani.greenpeace.or.id&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contacts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Therese Salvador, Media Campaigner, Greenpeace Philippines, &lt;a href="tel:%2B639178228734" target="_blank"&gt;+639178228734&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hindun Mulaika, Climate and Renewable Energy campaigner, Greenpeace Indonesia, &lt;a href="tel:%2B628118407113" target="_blank"&gt;+628118407113&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hikmat Soeriatanuwijaya, Media Campaigner, Greenpeace Indonesia, &lt;a href="tel:%2B628111805394" target="_blank"&gt;+628111805394&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo and video requests:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Debby Natalia, Assistant Media Campaigner, Greenpeace Indonesia, &lt;a href="tel:%2B628111928315" target="_blank"&gt;+628111928315&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Godi Utama, Video Producer, Greenpeace Indonesia, &lt;a href="tel:%2B628118164230" target="_blank"&gt;+628118164230&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today celebrated Thailand’s Rice Masterplan for keeping Thai rice free of genetically-modified organisms (GMOs).  The GE-free rice policy, a key strategy in the Thai Rice Masterplan, protects Thailand’s thousands-year old rice heritage from the inherent risks posed by genetically-engineered (GE) crops.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;For the occasion, Greenpeace unveiled a gigantic eco-friendly 3D artwork of an organic farm, an illustration of healthy, ecological farming, at Museum of Siam, Bangkok.   The event comes ahead of the National Rice and Farmers Day on June 5th to celebrate the pride of Thai rice tradition and wisdom of Thai farmers who can produce safe food without the need of GE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Thai government’s strategy to keep rice production GE-free is an acknowledgement embedded in government policy that genetically-engineered (GE) crops are unnecessary and a risk to a sustainable future for farming.  This is a victory for rice farmers and consumers because it affirms the commitment of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives to keep rice farming sustainable and rice crops free of environmental and health risks associated with GE crops,” said Natwipha Ewasakul, Sustainable Agriculture Campaigner for Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace supports this strategy and we are happy to assist the government keep rice GE-free from now on.  We also welcome government commitment to keep this GE-free policy beyond 2011,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current Thai Rice Masterplan conceived by the MoAC covers the enforcement period of 2007-2011.  The plan committed to strengthening the nation’s rice production while promoting farmers’ livelihoods and consumer confidence.  Keeping Thai rice GMO-free means that Thailand maintains its global leadership in rice production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace maintains that GMOs  threaten the future and biodiversity of rice in Thailand, and will make farming, and farmers, dependent on agricultural inputs exclusively owned by giant multinational corporations who control GMO technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The huge 3D artwork presented by Greenpeace today during the festivities stands for the millions people around the world who aspire for a sustainable and secure future of food.  It was first launched in December 2010 front of the European Commission in Brussels, to accompany a signature petition by 1 million people clamouring for GE-free farming.  The petition, organized together with Avaaz [1] is an unprecedented EU-wide citizens’ initiative aimed at the European Commission calling for safe food and stopping genetically modified crops in the EU. The artwork is an ecological farm symbolizing the future of agriculture with no GMO crops, surrounded by the 1 million names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The policy asserts how the need for agriculture that is good for the planet and people is important to our country and our economy.  But it’s not just Thailand who stands to benefit from such a bold move.  Consumers around the world know that they can trust Thai rice. These 1 million people know that GMO crops are bad for food and farming and this demand is shared by people in Thailand,” said Natwipha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and the Thai Farmer’s Network also organized a Thai rice exhibition which traces the history and tradition of Thai rice, Thai rice varieties and the profound relationship between Thai people and their staple diet. The exhibition also highlights the threats and dangers of GMOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3D art work and the Thai farmer network’s exhibit will be open to the public from 2 to 5 June 2011. Meanwhile, Greenpeace’s exhibition on Thai Rice and GE-free farming will be open from 2 to 30 June at Museum of Siam, 10.00 am – 6.00 pm (daily, except Mondays).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is an independent global campaigning organisation that acts to change attitudes and behaviour, to protect and conserve the environment and to promote peace.&lt;/p&gt;

	Pelalawan, 28 September 2011: On the eighth day of the Greenpeace "Tiger Eyes" tour, Greenpeace activists continued to bear witness to the pathetic sight of Sumatran forests being destroyed by pulp and paper companies.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Today, five Greenpeace activists arrived in the area around the village of Kusuma, District Pangkalan Kuras, Pelalawan regency of Riau Province, to see the condition of the forest which has become one of the Sumatran Tigers last remaining habitats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this area, Greenpeace activists  were bearing witness to the forests around Tesso Nilo being converted to acacia plantation by PT. Arara Abadi (a subsidiary of Asia Pulp and Paper-APP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, several Greenpeace activists accompanied the Center for Conservation of Natural Resources (BKSDA) Riau to this area in order to rescue a trapped Sumatran Tiger. Unfortunately the rescue effort failed to save the tiger’s life as it had been trapped for 7 days and was too weak to survive the rescue attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Greenpeace activists were shocked because in this area, the carbon-rich peatlands, more than three meters deep were destroyed. In addition to documenting these conditions, the activists unfurled banners reading "Save the Forests, Save the Tiger Home" encouraging all Indonesian people to participate in efforts to save Indonesia's remaining forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Today we are in one of the last remaining forests which is the home of  the endangered Sumatran tiger. We saw that destruction is still freely occurring, even on carbon-rich peat lands. Yesterday President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono expressed his commitment to save Indonesia's remaining forests. This commitment needs to materialize into concrete action so that destruction of this kind is immediately halted, "said Rusmadya Maharuddin, Greenpeace Southeast Asia forest campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We must fight to save Indonesia's remaining forests. We're presenting evidence of this destruction, and inviting all  Indonesians to join us and be the “eyes of a tiger” ' (1). The companies responsible must stop their destructive practices and shift to more responsible operations, while the Government must review all existing concessions and protect peatland immediately," Rusmadya added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sumatran tiger's forest habitat is being destroyed, with only around 400 left in the wild. The Indonesian government estimates that more than one million hectares of forest are being cleared every year. With the current rates of forest destruction, this magnificent animal that has inspired Indonesia's rich culture, is likely to follow its predecessors, the Javanese and Bali tiger, into extinction.&lt;/p&gt;

	Barbie, the most famous toy in the world, is involved in rainforest destruction, a Greenpeace International investigation can today reveal.
Packaging for the doll is produced using timber from the rainforests of Indonesia, home to endangered species such as the Sumatran tiger.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;7 June 2011- Greenpeace activists, dressed in tuxedos to mimic Barbie’s boyfriend Ken, have scaled Mattel’s Los Angeles HQ with a giant banner which reads: “Barbie: It’s Over. I Don’t Date Girls That Are Into Deforestation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activity in Los Angeles marks the start of a worldwide Greenpeace campaign to stop toy companies driving deforestation in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace investigators used forensic testing to reveal that Barbie’s packaging comes from the Indonesian rainforests. They also used a combination of ‘in country’ investigation, mapping data and traced company certificates to show that Mattel, the makers of Barbie, along with other toy companies including Disney, are using packaging produced by Asia Pulp and Paper (APP). APP has been exposed many times for wrecking Indonesia’s rainforests to make products such as packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bustar Maitar, head of Greenpeace’s campaign to save the forests in Indonesia, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Barbie is trashing rainforests and pushing critically-endangered wildlife, like tigers, towards extinction. This is happening because Barbie’s packaging comes from the rainforests of Indonesia, home to species like the Sumatran tiger".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mattel, which makes Barbie, must stop wrapping the world’s most famous toy in rainforest destruction. Mattel must stop buying packaging from APP, a notorious rainforest destroyer which has been exposed many times for wrecking Indonesia’s rainforests to make throw-away packaging".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“APP is bad news for Indonesia’s forests. It treats Indonesia as nothing more than a vast disposable asset, grabbing rainforests that are vital to forest communities. Mattel, and other toy companies like Disney, have a responsibility to support clean, low carbon development. They should drop APP right now and instead support responsible Indonesian producers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia has one of the fastest rates of forest destruction in the world. The Indonesian government estimates that more than one million hectares of rainforests are being cleared every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta already suffers from dangerous levels of air pollution, from traffic, residential emissions and coalfired power. It’s rare for the air quality to meet standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO); the pollution levels are frequently even worse than the much weaker standards set by the Indonesian government. And the situation is about to get much worse.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Government is proposing another four coal-fired power plants in the region (seven units), to add to the existing eight plants (22 units). One existing plant would be expanded. If these disastrous plans go ahead, Greater Jakarta would be ringed by power stations, which will choke the city and its 30 million inhabitants. While China is closing coal-fired power plants in Beijing to curb dangerous levels of air pollution, Indonesia is doing the opposite. Greater Jakarta could see more new coal-fired power stations built within 100 kilometres than any other capital city. The pollution from these new power plants – NO2, particulate matter and SO2 - is equivalent to putting an extra 10 million cars 1 on Jakarta’s streets. Yet there has been no assessment of the impact on the air quality and health of the millions of people living in Greater Jakarta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emissions from the new and existing coal-fired power plants would put at risk the health of everyone in Greater Jakarta, including 7.8 million children, by exposing them to PM2.5 levels way above WHO guidelines. The health impacts of this pollution across the region would include a projected 10,600 premature deaths and 2,800 low birth weight births per year; nearly half of these would be within Greater Jakarta. The regulation and enforcement of emissions standards for key pollutants, such as PM2.5, SO2, NO2 and dust, is extremely weak in Indonesia. The new coal-fired power plants will be allowed to emit 20 times as much SO2 as new plants in China, and more than 7 times as much as new plants in India.&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 19 March 2018 - Eight major household brands such as PZ Cussons, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Kraft Heinz are refusing to say where their palm oil comes from, despite promising to stop buying from companies that destroy rainforests. Eight others, such as Nestlé and Unilever, have made their palm oil supply chains more transparent.

This comes as a new report by Greenpeace International, Moment of Truth, finds brands are not on track to meet their commitments to a clean palm oil supply chain by 2020. [1]
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Download Moment of Truth Report" href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/publication/15395/moment-of-truth/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/Global/seasia/image/moment.png" alt="" width="331" height="473"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Brands have repeatedly promised to end deforestation for palm oil by 2020. With less than two years to go they are way off track. Some, such as Nestlé and Unilever, have at least come clean about that. Others, including PZ Cussons, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and Kraft Heinz, are still keeping customers in the dark,” said Kiki Taufik, Global Head of the Indonesian forests campaign at Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In 2010, consumer brands pledged to eliminate deforestation from palm oil and other key commodities by 2020. [2] There is growing evidence that they will fail to meet this deadline with dangerous consequences for the climate. [3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In January 2018, Greenpeace International challenged 16 leading brands to disclose their palm oil suppliers, along with the mills that produced the palm oil they used. [4] This would show whether brands continue to source from forest destroyers. Eight brands have now disclosed this information. Eight refused to say where their palm oil comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Alarmingly, the destruction of Indonesia’s rainforests for palm oil shows no sign of slowing down. [5] In case after case, NGOs have linked major brands to palm oil companies that destroy rainforests and exploit people. [6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “Despite corporate commitments to reform this dirty industry, palm oil remains a high-risk commodity. Brands need to come clean about where their palm oil comes from and cut off growers that refuse to change their destructive ways,” said Kiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Greenpeace analysis of official government data suggests that Indonesia has lost 24 million hectares of rainforest between 1990 and 2015. In the last three years to 2015, 146 football fields of rainforest were destroyed every hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Indonesia has more threatened and endangered species than any other country, largely due to the destruction of their habitats. The Bornean orangutan population has decreased by half since 1999 with over 100,000 individuals lost in the past 16 years.  In 2017, a new species of orangutan was discovered in Sumatra, but it is already endangered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Forest and peatland destruction by the plantation sector have created the conditions for devastating forest fires, many set deliberately by companies clearing land. In 2015, Indonesia suffered devastating forest fires, which spread a toxic haze across Southeast Asia, resulting in an estimated 100,000 premature deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

	Manila - The Commission on Human Rights in the Philippines have called on 47 carbon producers to attend a preliminary meeting in its investigation into their corporate responsibility for climate-related human rights abuses (1). The companies include ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, Total, BHP Billiton, Suncor, and ConocoPhillips.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This is the first opportunity for the Filipino petitioners to meet representatives of the fossil fuel companies face-to-face. Though carbon producers might choose to ignore the request for their attendance, the preliminary conference is set to take place on 11 December, in which the petitioners and companies need to discuss and agree evidence submission and witness testimonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an unprecedented moment in the climate justice movement and especially for the thousands of typhoon survivors who are living with the impacts of climate change,” said Desiree Llanos Dee, Climate Justice campaigner for Greenpeace Southeast Asia in the Philippines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filipino typhoon survivors, other communities suffering the impacts of climate change, and civil society organizations, including Greenpeace Southeast Asia (Philippines), initially petitioned the Commission for the investigation in 2015 (2), two years after super-typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) claimed the lives of more than 6,300 people and affected millions of others who have yet to recover (3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission has full authority, based on its mandate under the Philippine Constitution, to investigate human rights harms in the Philippines, including impacts resulting from the companies’ global activities (4). So far, the companies have been using ‘courtroom tactics’ in an effort to avoid public scrutiny of their business activities that are contributing to human rights harms (5). Failure to attend the 11 December preliminary meeting would be a reflection of its lack of commitment to its corporate responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All the recent extreme weather events - from hurricanes in the US to monsoon flooding in South Asia - is not a coincidence. It’s the result of climate change,” said Llanos Dee. “A wave of climate justice cases are happening around the world, so while fossil fuel companies may try to run, they can’t hide. The science is clear: pollution from fossil fuel companies drives climate change, and this move by the Commission sends a strong signal around the world that those responsible for climate change will be held accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite knowing the severe risks posed by climate change for decades (6), the fossil fuel industry continues to drive climate change (7). The trend towards renewable energy is growing (8) and, with the Paris Agreement in force, a move towards an era free from fossil fuels is inevitable, along with a just transition for workers and communities affected by the industry’s downfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Philippines is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, and the petitioners will not back down,” said AG Saño, visual artist, activist, and one of the petitioners who survived super-typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We urge the CEOs of these major carbon producers to fully participate in the investigation, publicise their plans for stopping their use of fossil fuels, and explain how they intend to eliminate, remedy, or prevent human rights harms from climate change. Fossil fuels need to stay in the ground. After all we want to thrive and not just survive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many homes were destroyed during Typhoon Yolanda and people died - including some I knew,” said Isagani Serrano, president of the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement (PRRM), an organisation that provides support in the aftermath of disasters. “We hope these CEOs look deep in their hearts and see how their profit harms people and the planet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AG Saño will continue his advocacy for climate justice by representing the Filipino petitioners at COP 23 in Bonn in November.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace  marked the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster with a call to governments of Southeast Asia to abandon all plans of developing nuclear power plants in the region to ensure the safety of its citizens.  Greenpeace is calling on Philippine President Noynoy Aquino to invest heavily in energy efficiency and harness clean, safe renewable energies to meet the country’s energy requirements instead of dirty coal and dangerous nuclear energy.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 3px;" src="/seasia/PageFiles/292537/20110426-DOE-10.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"&gt;In Metro Manila, Greenpeace activists in black cloaks and masks took the message to the doorsteps of the Department of Energy, as they held a grim procession highlighting 25 of the world’s worst nuclear disasters to challenge Energy Secretary Jose Almendras to strike out all nuclear options in Philippine energy plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Chernobyl is to date the world’s worst civilian nuclear accident, but the unfolding disaster in Fukushima, Japan, demonstrates that no amount of technological sophistication or safety culture can prepare any country or its people for the inherent dangers of nuclear energy.  Like in Chernobyl, the Fukushima incident has shown that we cannot control or manage nuclear energy and its fallout,” said Amalie Obusan, Greenpeace Southeast Asia Climate and Energy Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quarter of a century after Chernobyl, the situation in the area surrounding the Chernobyl reactor shows few signs of improvement.  Widespread contamination, constant resettlements and long-term health impacts still pose threats to communities.  And, despite ‘modernizations’, the root causes of nuclear technology’s vulnerability to accidents remain the same: unexpected technological failures, operator errors, poor safety standards due to political and economic pressures, lack of transparency in the industry as a whole, and natural disasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the Philippine Energy Plan for 2009-2030 still contains options for the adoption of nuclear power in the country.   Under the Energy Reform Agenda of the current administration, part of the DOE’s thrusts for 2013-2016 is to strengthen policy researches and studies in aid of executive and legislative action that will facilitate the operation of a 2,000-megawatt nuclear power plant in 2025.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strong public resistance in 2008 derailed plans to revive the mothballed Bataan Nuclear Power Plant.  But the Philippines, as with rest of the ASEAN countries, despite their vulnerability to natural disasters in the Pacific “ring of fire” and their general lack of disaster preparedness, have not yet ruled out nuclear power and the great costs and risks it entails.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Costs to manage the Chernobyl disaster which up to now continues to drain Ukraine and Europe millions of Euro annually, is estimated to cost more than 13 times the Philippine government’s budget for 2011.  The disaster also severely contaminated between 125,000 and 150,000 square kilometres (equivalent to around half the Philippines’ total land area) in Belarus, Russia and the Ukraine.  A Greenpeace-commissioned study based on Belarus national cancer statistics estimated that approximately 270,000 cancers and 93,000 fatal cancer cases will be caused by Chernobyl.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace believes that to secure a safe and better future, countries must choose renewable energy over nuclear power.  Greenpeace has long argued that renewable energy has the potential to meet a substantial share of our future energy demand. The Energy [R]evolution scenario details how – combined with energy efficiency and a transformed electricity grid – renewable energy could produce 95% of electricity worldwide by 2050. Other studies have made predictions for different time frames or regions. PricewaterhouseCoopers, for example, predicts that Europe and North Africa could run on 100% renewable energy by 2050.

	Jakarta, Wednesday 19 September 2018 - Palm oil suppliers to the world’s largest brands, including Unilever, Nestlé, Colgate-Palmolive and Mondelez, have destroyed an area of rainforest almost twice the size of Singapore in less than three years, according to a new investigation by Greenpeace International. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Greenpeace International assessed deforestation by 25 major palm oil producers and found that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;25 palm oil groups had cleared over 130,000ha of rainforest since the end of 2015&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;40% of deforestation (51,600ha) was in Papua, Indonesia - one of the most biodiverse regions on earth and until recently untouched by the palm oil industry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;12 brands were sourcing from at least 20 of the palm oil groups: Colgate-Palmolive, General Mills, Hershey, Kellogg’s, Kraft Heinz, L’Oreal, Mars, Mondelez, Nestlé, PepsiCo, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Wilmar, the world’s largest palm oil trader, was buying from 18 of the palm oil groups&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/p4-production-content/international/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/7d4b5ba9-final_countdown_pages_lr_greenpeace_19092018.pdf"&gt;The investigation&lt;/a&gt; exposes the total failure of Wilmar International, the world’s largest palm oil trader, to break its links to rainforest destruction. In 2013, Greenpeace International revealed that Wilmar and its suppliers were &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Forests-Reports/Licence-to-kill/"&gt;responsible for deforestation, illegal clearance, fires on peatland and extensive clearance of tiger habitat&lt;/a&gt;. Later that year, Wilmar announced a groundbreaking ‘&lt;a href="http://www.wilmar-international.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/No-Deforestation-No-Peat-No-Exploitation-Policy.pdf"&gt;no deforestation, no peat, no exploitation’ policy&lt;/a&gt;. Yet Greenpeace’s analysis found that Wilmar still gets its palm oil from groups that are destroying rainforests and stealing land from local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Palm oil can be produced without destroying rainforests. But our investigation shows that the palm oil Wilmar trades is still utterly contaminated with rainforest destruction. Household brands like Unilever, Nestlé, Colgate-Palmolive and Mondelez promised their customers they’d only use clean palm oil but they haven’t kept that promise. Brands must fix this problem once and for all by cutting Wilmar off until it can prove its palm oil is clean,” said Kiki Taufik, head of Greenpeace’s global Indonesia forests campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to deforestation, the 25 individual cases in the report include evidence of exploitation and social conflicts, illegal deforestation, development without permits, plantation development in areas zoned for protection and forest fires linked to land clearance. It is also the most comprehensive assessment of deforestation in Papua, Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Papua is one of the most biodiverse places on earth, and its pristine forests had until recently been spared the destruction happening elsewhere in Indonesia. But now the palm oil industry is moving in and clearing forest at an alarming rate. If we don’t stop them then Papua’s beautiful forests will be destroyed for palm oil just like Sumatra and Kalimantan,” said Taufik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palm oil impacts on environment, people and climate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30086-1"&gt;Half of the Bornean orangutan population has been wiped out in just 16 years&lt;/a&gt;, with habitat destruction by the palm oil industry a leading driver. More than three-quarters of Tesso Nilo national park, home to tigers, orangutans and elephants, &lt;a href="http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?264971/Eyes-on-the-Forest-report-Global-supply-chains-still-tainted-with-illegal-palm-oil"&gt;has been converted into illegal palm oil plantations&lt;/a&gt;. Globally, 193 species classified as Critically Endangered, Endangered and Vulnerable, are &lt;a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/palm-oil-and-biodiversity"&gt;threatened by palm oil production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The plantation sector - palm oil and pulp - is the single largest driver of deforestation in Indonesia. Around 24 million hectares of rainforest was destroyed in Indonesia between 1990 and 2015, according to official figures released by the Indonesian government [1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Deforestation and peatland destruction are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to climate change. This has pushed Indonesia into the &lt;a href="https://www.wri.org/blog/2017/04/interactive-chart-explains-worlds-top-10-emitters-and-how-theyve-changed"&gt;top tier of global emitters, alongside the United States of America and China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Plantation development is a root cause of Indonesia’s forest and peatland fires. In July 2015, devastating blazes spread in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Papua. These fires produced a haze that affected millions of people across Southeast Asia. Researchers at Harvard and Columbia Universities estimate that the &lt;a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2016/09/smoke-from-2015-indonesian-fires-may-have-caused-100000-premature-deaths"&gt;smoke from 2015 Indonesian fires may have caused 100,000 premature deaths&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/776101467990969768/The-cost-of-fire-an-economic-analysis-of-Indonesia-s-2015-fire-crisis"&gt;The World Bank calculated the cost of the disaster at US$16bn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Wilmar International and other palm oil companies are regularly &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/11/palm-oil-global-brands-profiting-from-child-and-forced-labour/"&gt;accused of exploiting workers, children and local communities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	Washington, DC - Nestlé, the world’s largest food and beverage company, released a statement [1] today aimed at addressing the growing plastic pollution crisis. The company’s statement does not include clear targets to reduce and eventually phase out single-use plastics. Instead, it announced “ambition” for its packaging to be 100% recyclable or reusable by 2025, plans for “continuing to increase the proportion of recycled plastics in packaging” without a clear timeline, and additional efforts to help facilitate recycling by consumers.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In response to today’s news, Greenpeace Oceans Campaigner Graham Forbes said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nestlé’s statement on plastic packaging includes more of the same greenwashing baby steps to tackle a crisis it helped to create. It will not actually move the needle toward the reduction of single-use plastics in a meaningful way, and sets an incredibly low standard as the largest food and beverage company in the world. The statement is full of ambiguous or nonexistent targets, relies on ‘ambitions’ to do better, and puts the responsibility on consumers rather than the company to clean up its own plastic pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Identified as one of the worst plastic polluters in cleanups and brand audits around the world, Nestle is accountable to do more to address the problem. It is in the position and has the power and resources to phase out single-use plastics towards zero-waste in its packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A company of Nestlé’s size should be setting a strong standard to actually move away from throwaway plastics. It should know by now that recycling efforts are not going to clean up our oceans, waterways, and communities. On the contrary, the company’s business as usual will only accelerate plastic pollution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestlé was the&lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/nestle-unilever-pg-among-worst-offenders-for-plastic-pollution-in-philippines-beach-audit/"&gt; worst polluter identified&lt;/a&gt; as part of an 8-day cleanup and brand audit of plastic pollution found at Freedom Island in the Philippines in 2017. The company’s products have a consistent presence in cleanups and&lt;a href="http://plasticpolluters.org/"&gt; brand audits completed around the world&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

	Ladies and Gentlemen,

Welcome to Thailand, for yet another round of Climate change negotiations at the UN climate change conference to be held in Bangkok between April 3-8, 2011.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 4px;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/ReSizes/ImageGalleryLarge/PageFiles/287379/afab-asean%20%2815%29.jpg" alt="" width="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that the front page headlines of local newspapers of the unfolding disaster in Southern Thailand grab your attention and we hope that despite the recent UN directive relaxing dress codes at the meeting (no more stuffy suits), you are carrying a cardigan to keep you warm in the unexpected cold wave that has gripped this city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For lot of ordinary Thai citizens, in fact all people in the ASEAN  region, climate change is neither a debate, nor a war between science  and opinion, but a reality, and they are getting increasingly aware of  how vulnerable and unprepared they are to its impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the debacle at the 2009 UN meeting in Copenhagen, world leaders  missed a chance to take decisive action on climate change and lost the  momentum built by the unprecedented science and public clamor demanding  action. But we shall let bygones be bygones, and look forward to the  gains made at your last summit in Cancun in 2010, dubbed by many as a  success of multilaterism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres was recently quoted  saying “the world was at a crossroads in Cancun and took a step forward  towards a climate-safe world, now governments must move purposefully  down the path they have set, and that means maintaining momentum at  Bangkok in order to take the next big climate step in Durban at the end  of the year."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sincerely hope that is the case, after all, the meeting in Bangkok  will be the first time governments will gather after Cancun to take  forward their agreed objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of emission cuts, the Cancun meeting outcome made clear  progress. The governments agreed to a temperature goal, which is to stay  below 2 degrees warming compared to pre-industrial levels.  Strengthening this goal will be considered in light of 1.5 degrees  warming after the next IPCC report (by 2015). Countries agreed to take  urgent action to meet this goal consistent with science and on the basis  of equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A top-down approach to emission reductions was re-introduced, after  it almost got lost in Copenhagen. Governments formally acknowledged that  the targets developed countries have individually pledged bottom up are  not enough and they must be increased to meet altogether at least 40 %  emissions reductions from 1990 levels by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context also the role of accounting loopholes was  acknowledged, which is important. Also developing countries agreed to  take ambitious action and to significantly improve the measuring,  reporting and verifying of their emission reductions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly all countries acknowledged in Cancun that a  low-carbon development strategy is indispensable to sustainable  development. New institutions agreed in Mexico last year include a Green  Climate Fund to house the international management, deployment and  accountability of long-term funds for developing country support; a  Technology Mechanism to promote clean technologies; and an Adaptation  Framework to boost international cooperation to help developing  countries protect themselves from climate change impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is important that governments maintain momentum at Bangkok by  agreeing to a clear work-plan. And well, if it is not asking for too  much, the UNFCCC work programme for this year needs to include the  politically sensitive issues, in particular governments need to reserve  time to discuss how to increase the level of ambition when it comes to  reducing emissions. In other words: they must start talking about the  fact that in order to avoid catastrophic climate change, the level of  ambition has to be increased, and this has to happen fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world needs a Fair, Ambitious, Legally binding Global Climate  Deal. But with the USA and their navel gazing and pre-occupations with  establishing democracies around the world, this is unlikely to happen.  However, this doesn't prevent others from moving forward and showing  leadership. The reward for showing leadership is green jobs,  technological leadership and a head start in the race to the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand that the Bangkok agenda includes two important  workshops ahead of the formal negotiations which can bring further  clarity to the emissions reduction plans of industrialised countries and  the emission efforts of developing countries. We genuinely hope that  these workshops help building strong mechanisms and possible market  incentives that allow everyone to work together to cut emissions at a  cheaper and faster rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And please, ladies and gentleman, it's wrong to think that the  situation in Japan should slow down the climate process. We're not in a  situation where we have to choose between nuclear disasters or climate  disasters. We have the green technology we need to choose a green future  powered by renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh yes, it’s a good idea to carry an umbrella at all times and maybe  even keep gumboots, you never know, how and where Ms. La Nina strikes  these days. Welcome to Climate Change.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Shailendra Yashwant, Campaign Director Greenpeace Southeast Asia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Quezon City, Philippines, 28 August 2018 - Some of the world’s most highly-regarded climate change science, policy, research, and legal experts will appear as witnesses in the ongoing hearings by the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) in the Philippines on the responsibility of 47 fossil fuel companies for the global climate crisis.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p class="m8229844287237004084normal"&gt;The hearing, the third in the series, is part of the CHR investigation looking into the role of companies like ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Suncor and Repsol, in worsening climate change and its impacts on people’s lives. It was triggered by a petition filed in 2015 before the CHR by representatives of communities across the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m8229844287237004084normal"&gt;“The Commission on Human Rights is taking a bold step with its inquiry on how the products of 47 major fossil fuel companies have changed the global atmosphere and the companies’ potential accountability for violating the human rights of Filipinos,” said Richard Heede, Co-founder and Director of the Climate Accountability Institute, based in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m8229844287237004084normal"&gt;On 29 and 30 August, these international experts will present their published research findings into the industry’s contribution to climate change, and how these companies knew about the risks but chose to mislead the public. Experts will also explain how climate change is harming Filipinos and the legal basis for corporate accountability for climate change.[1] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m8229844287237004084normal"&gt;Richard Heede, one of five international experts, is the principal investigator of the &lt;a href="http://www.climateaccountability.org/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.climateaccountability.org/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1535518459893000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGKhdvruhtLN_F5C7WkeIWh483qJA"&gt;Carbon Majors Project&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013, he published a study that aggregated historical emissions according to carbon producing entities themselves. The study found that nearly two-thirds of carbon dioxide emitted since the 1750s can be traced to the 90 largest fossil fuel and cement producers, including the 47 companies being investigated by the CHR.[2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m8229844287237004084normal"&gt;“These companies have known for decades that their products would cause climate-related harm to populations and nations around the world, yet did little to minimise the risk, apparently preferring to protect profits over people. The Commission’s Inquiry should serve as a warning to fossil fuel producers that not aligning their business objectives with global science-based targets to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide threatens their long term viability,” said Heede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m8229844287237004084normal"&gt;National experts who have studied climate change impacts in the Philippines will also be appearing at the hearing, as well as community witnesses - those who have personally experienced and suffered at the hands of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m8229844287237004084normal"&gt;“In just two hours, Haiyan wiped away whole communities and everything we worked hard for. I was devastated by the friends I lost, but for those who survived, our fighting spirit lives on,” said Arthur Golong, a transgender community leader from Tacloban city, which was severely impacted by super typhoon Haiyan in November 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m8229844287237004084normal"&gt;“The Philippines experiences up to 20 typhoons a year and climate change is throwing more anger into the eye of the storm. At some point there needs to be accountability and global change, for the sake of small cities like Tacloban and everywhere else around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m8229844287237004084normal"&gt;With the global spread of heatwaves and wildfires currently happening across the northern hemisphere, and floods, droughts and severe storms in other parts of the world, the chain of events is consistent with the predictions of a climate changed world.[3] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m8229844287237004084normal"&gt;“This investigation can shift global understanding of corporate responsibility for climate change by bringing attention to the role of fossil fuel companies in creating the climate crisis,” said Desiree Llanos Dee, Campaigner from Greenpeace Southeast Asia-Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m8229844287237004084normal"&gt;“The witnesses who will be testifying have years of experience and have solid evidence pointing to what these carbon majors knew, but chose not to act upon, about their businesses’ impact on the climate. We are confident that this will be a major turning point in these human rights hearings and these companies will finally be forced to take responsibility for their actions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m8229844287237004084normal"&gt;The next series of hearings will take place in New York on September 27-28, followed by other hearings and consultations happening throughout the rest of the year in London and Manila.&lt;/p&gt;

	Phuket, 12 June 2018--A new report released today revealed that a shift to 100% renewable energy will generate more than 170,000 jobs in the country in the next three decades. The report[1], the first of its kind to quantify renewable energy job creation in Thailand and the Mekong Region, shows how, if properly supported, the RE sector can be a major growth driver for employment and the Thai economy.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p class="normal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;The report was launched in Phuket during the visit of the Greenpeace flagship, the Rainbow Warrior, which is in the country for its “Rainbow Warrior Ship Tour 2018: 100% Renewable Energy for All” tour. The ship is in the province to show how a transition to renewable energy not only helps avoid the most disastrous impacts of climate change, but also benefits the economy by providing more jobs and income, and fostering innovation, knowledge and skills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;“Thailand is known for its leadership in the renewable energy sector in Southeast Asia,” said economist Decharut Sukkamneod,a lecturer at Kasetsart University and the lead author of the report. “The study represents how, with renewable energy, Thailand can achieve sustainable development goals – in particular on promoting sustained and inclusive economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;The direct employment rate of Thailand’s renewable energy industry in 2016 was approximately 17,758 jobs, 80% of which was employed in the biomass industry (14,323 jobs), followed by solar energy industry (2,588 jobs), biogas (757 jobs) and lastly, wind energy (90 jobs). This is in stark contrast to the coal energy industry’s projected direct employment generation of only 1,950 jobs – even if it were to produce the same amount of electricity as the combined output of the entire renewable energy sector. The study also projected that employment in the RE sector will rise to more than 27,000 jobs by 2019 if all the RE projects currently in the pipeline were approved. This figure is expected to rise more than six-fold to 172,164 jobs in 2050 under a 100% RE scenario.[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;The study team, composed of renewable energy experts from universities and institutions across country [3] looked at solar, wind, modern biomass, and biogas renewable energy projects across Thailand. The study on direct employment focused on three phases: (a) construction (b) operation and maintenance and (c) feedstock preparation. Projections on direct employment are based on four scenarios of electricity generation: (a) existing renewable energy projects in 2016, (b) renewable energy projects that are already committed by 2019, (c) 100% RE in Thailand by 2050, and (d) 100% RE in the lower Mekong region (Lao PDR, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam) by 2050.[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;“The study shows that renewable energy is a win-win solution, while fossil fuel, particularly coal power, is a losing proposition,” said Chariya Senpong, Climate and Energy Campaigner for Greenpeace Southeast Asia. “It also shows the importance of incorporating employment projections into energy planning processes, and in particular in the Power Development Plan, in order to better guide policy making. Additionally, the government needs to ensure that strong policies are in place to reinforce human resources and trainings, research and development, as well as occupational health and safety to support a booming renewable energy sector and a just and sustainable energy transition.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;“It’s clear that a shift to renewable energy brings multiple benefits at both local and national levels: it is good for the environment and good for business,” said Chariya. “Investing in and facilitating different scales of renewable energy projects can generate thousands of decent jobs in Thailand, make electricity more economical for consumers while protecting the environment, and increasing GDP. It also poses fewer risks for Thailand’s future, as opposed to investing in coal.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	“New standards for ‘sustainable’ palm oil must be enforced immediately”, says Greenpeace
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jakarta, 15 November 2018 --&lt;/strong&gt; In response to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) &lt;a href="https://www.rspo.org/ga/ga15/Resolutions/RSPO_P&amp;amp;C_2018.pdf"&gt;voting to incorporate ‘no deforestation’ standards into its Principles and Criteria (P&amp;amp;C)&lt;/a&gt;, Kiki Taufik, Head of Greenpeace Indonesia Global Forest Campaign said:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;“Adopting no deforestation into the RSPO's standards is an important step towards breaking the links between certified palm oil and forest destruction. However, the new rules will take at least two years to come into effect and right now numerous RSPO members are destroying rainforests with impunity [1]. RSPO must address this immediately if it is to make a real difference on the ground”.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[1] In September 2018, Greenpeace International’s Final Countdown report exposed significant recent deforestation or other violations by 14 RSPO members or associated parties, including Bumitama Agri Limited (on the RSPO Complaints Panel) and FELDA/FGV and IOI, both members of the RSPO Board of Governors. An additional producer group, Gama Plantation is very closely associated with RSPO member Wilmar International.&lt;/div&gt;

	In many places a waste management system exists that claims to dispose, incinerate or recycle collected plastic waste. In reality, most of the plastic waste generated in high-income countries is transported to low- and middle- income countries, where the plastic waste is imported to be recycled or further processed. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt; In January 2018, high-income countries lost their major importer when China banned most imports of plastic wastes. Southeast Asian nations eagerly jumped in to fill the gap, with Malaysia taking the lead by importing nearly half a million tonnes between January and July 2018 [1]. An international trade system, based on multilateral agreements, is supposed to regulate the selling, buying, importing and exporting of recyclable plastic wastes. A recent Greenpeace* investigation shows that this international trade system is broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section"&gt;
&lt;div class="layoutArea"&gt;
&lt;div class="column"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The imported waste is often not processed correctly but dumped or burned in essentially unregulated ways, in violation of international agreements. Criminal actors in Southeast Asia have abused the inability of legal operators and failure of authorities to cope with the increased imports to make quick, dirty money. After protests by Malaysian activists and a number of news articles decrying how apparently illegal operators have been harmfully dumping the waste in unsuitable places or burning it openly, the Malaysian government, among other nations took steps to address the issue by imposing a temporary import ban on plastic waste. This ban was recently turned into a permanent ban for plastic scrap. However, the official definition of plastic scraps remains vague. In addition. Malaysia said it would only phase out plastic waste imports entirely over the next three years [2]. During the investigation, Greenpeace was shocked by the extent of the environmental pollution and health conditions likely caused by illegal burning and dumping of imported plastic waste. The temporary ban on imports in Malaysia did not halt unregulated or poorly regulated burning and dumping activities. These are still ongoing. Existing monitoring and enforcement policies and practices in Malaysia are inadequate to put a stop to these operations.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	Krabi, 13 June 2018- Krabi Province can lead the renewable energy (RE) transition in Thailand and achieve 100% RE by 2026. According to a report by Greenpeace Southeast Asia, the Healthy Public Policy Foundation, Thammasart University and Save Andaman from Coal Network, this can be possible with a combination of modern biomass, biogas, solar, wind and mini-hydropower managed under an RE smart grid. The groups are calling on local and national policy makers to make this transition a reality.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The report, entitled &lt;em&gt;Krabi Goes Green&lt;/em&gt;, shows the results of a study on electricity consumption and generation plans in Krabi for the next 20 years (2018-2037). The study projects a total electricity generation potential of 1,676 MW (installed capacity) mainly from renewable energy sources. In just three years, by 2021, Krabi can already be 100% dependent on renewable energy for at least two hours a day. A gradual transition to 100% RE can be completed in the next five years, by 2026. All that is needed is political will, strong policy support, unlocked regulations on renewable energy, and grid reforms on energy carrying capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Krabi’s potential transition to 100% RE will benefit not just local communities and the province, but the entire country, and can serve as a model for sustainable and inclusive development,” said Somnuk Krodsua from Save Pakasai Group of Krabi. “Shifting to RE will not only contribute to reducing the impacts of climate change, it will also protect our environment, secure our livelihoods, and ensure a good future for our children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “Krabi’s transition to 100% RE will serve as a province-wide model of sustainability. Krabi can benefit at both socio-economic and environmental fronts, including lower import burdens, increased contributions to economic growth, higher employment, and lower greenhouse gas emissions” said Assoc. Prof. Dr. Chalie Charoenlarpnopparut, of Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology (SIIT). “ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The shift will also require a pragmatic public policy that: 1) prioritises the entry of renewable energy into the grid before any energy generated from existing fossil fuel plants, 2) incentivizes renewable energy at a proper rate that balances the electricity cost regulation and investment, 3) reorients state enterprises related to electricity generation systems to espouse a renewable energy mindset, and 4) development and modernisation of smart grids and efficient electricity management systems at the grid level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “&lt;em&gt;Krabi Goes Green &lt;/em&gt;is a priority master plan that aims to provide energy justice, good governance and public participation. It also heralds the closing stages of Thailand’s dependence on coal-fired power plants,” said Chariya Senpong, Climate and Energy Campaigner for Greenpeace Southeast Asia. “Renewable energy would certainly promote a prosperous economy, thriving tourism and improved quality of life for all. The end of coal era in Thailand can happen sooner if all cities map out a renewable energy path that will permeate provincial energy and investment planning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krabi Goes Green&lt;/em&gt;, was launched today on board the Greenpeace flagship, the Rainbow Warrior. The ship is in the country for its “100% Renewable Energy for All” tour to show how a transition to renewable energy not only helps avoid the most disastrous impacts of climate change, but also benefits the economy by providing more jobs and income, and fostering innovation, knowledge and skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;Even as Greenpeace welcomed the inclusion of the GHECO - Glow 1 coal fired power plant in the list of harmful industries, the environment group expressed its disappointment with Prime Minister Abhisit's proposed solution to erect a buffer zone between the industrial estates and residential communities as the move not only attempts to downscale and deny the problem, but also betrays the government's ignorance about the nature of pollution itself.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"The idea of a buffer zone is ridiculous. The phenomenon of climate change is a constant reminder to the fact that toxic pollution, like carbon dioxide emissions, knows no borders. It is also a well known fact that toxic chemicals are made all the more dangerous because of their ability to resist degradation in the environment and to contaminate life across the corners of the planet by travelling on air currents, water, and through the food chain,”&lt;/strong&gt; said Tara Buakamsri, Country Representative of Greenpeace in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/PageFiles/158355/20101002_GP_entered_MTPIE001.jpg" alt="" width="590"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The right to a clean and healthy environment is assured in the Thai constitution and dirty development which imperils the lives of communities infringes on this basic right that should be safeguarded by the government. The technologies that will put Thailand on the path toward green development already exist. We are calling on the Thai government to prioritize and support green investments which will help put Thailand on a low-carbon growth pathway, instead of maintaining and carrying on with investments which propagate climate changing emissions and contribute to ecological degradation,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace concluded the Thailand leg of the Rainbow Warrior’s ‘Turn the Tide’ tour today with the end of the community demonstration at Map Ta Phut and after having participated in solidarity activities with local communities, people’s movements, and partner NGOs to promote a common vision of green development in Nakhon Si Thamarrat, Surathani, Koh Samui, Chumphon and Prachuab Kirikhan over the last 15 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"The Prime Minister cannot dismiss the call of Thai citizens to require all environmentally critical industries in the area to undergo health and environmental impact assessments. This demand embodies the minimum requirement that all governments subscribing to the notion of sustainable development should ensure. This is already standard environmental management practice in many countries worldwide.  Fundamentally, it is also the right and fair thing to do if the government is truly serious about upholding the rights of its citizens and ensuring that future generations will be enjoying the same environmental rights," &lt;/strong&gt;said Von Hernandez, Executive Director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the Government of Thailand to Turn The Tide of dirty development and invest in green development for a peaceful future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies by ending all subsidies to fossil-fuels, nuclear projects and energy-intensive industries in Thailand;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean up Chao Phraya river with clear timelines to reduce, restrict and ultimately eliminate discharges of toxic chemicals in all water sources of Thailand;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adopt national policies to promote sustainable agriculture practices in Thailand by banning genetically-engineered food crops and ending all subsidies to chemical pesticides and fertilizers in Thailand; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement strict measures to protect and stop further deforestation, as well as stop all development projects and policies that are potentially harmful to forest areas and biodiversity. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rainbow Warrior will continue her tour to promote sustainable development in Southeast Asia in Indonesia and the Philippines.  Greenpeace is calling on ASEAN member nations to support green investments and adopt low-carbon growth pathway for future development.&lt;/strong&gt;  The Tour marks 10 years of Greenpeace Southeast Asia campaigns to protect forests, catalyze an Energy Revolution, promote sustainable agriculture, and stop water pollution in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, 21 September - Indonesia’s President Joko ‘Jokowi’ Widodo has partially frozen new palm oil concessions in Indonesia for the next three years. [1] The moratorium only applies to land controlled by the Ministry of Forestry and does not cover land controlled by regional government or forest within existing palm oil concessions - leaving millions of hectares of rainforest and peatland unprotected.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In response to the announcement, Arie Rompas, Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s forest campaigner, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Jokowi’s announcement is a step forward but is marred by inconsistencies and loopholes. It is only temporary, leaves millions of hectares of forest unprotected and has no penalties. Indonesia’s palm oil industry has a serious reputational problem which the government could fix once and for all with a permanent ban on forest destruction, including within existing concessions”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement came a day after a &lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/p4-production-content/international/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/7d4b5ba9-final_countdown_pages_lr_greenpeace_19092018.pdf"&gt;Greenpeace International investigation revealed that 25 palm oil producers had cleared 130,000ha of rainforest since 2015&lt;/a&gt;. The investigation also uncovered illegal deforestation, development without permits, plantation development in areas zoned for protection and forest fires linked to land clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three year moratorium, which prevents the allocation of new palm oil concessions in the Forest Estate, the land controlled by the Central government, suffers from a number of weaknesses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It does not prevent the allocation of new concessions on the millions of hectares of natural forest in areas controlled by local government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It does not prevent companies clearing forest and developing peatlands within existing palm oil concessions. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It is in the form of a Presidential Instruction, which is not legally binding on government departments or local officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It contains no sanctions for non compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new palm oil moratorium conflicts with the Indonesian government stated commitment to ‘planned deforestation’, describing it in the State of the Forest 2018 report as ‘desirable when it results in a financial gain’. [3] Through its agrarian reform (TORA) and landswap programs the government of Indonesia continues to allocate new areas of land, much of which is still forested, for further plantation and agriculture development. This includes half a million hectares of forest earmarked for conversion to agriculture in the frontier Papuan provinces. [4]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;Meanwhile, the Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior anchored outside the Map Ta Phut port limits and unfurled a large banner stating “Turn The Tide” on its mast in solidarity with the members of the Eastern People's Network who have gathered in front of the Rayong administration center. The protestors are demanding that the government comply with provision 67 of Thailand¹s constitution and extend the list of 11 harmful activities to 18 types of industrial projects as recommended by the four-party panel head by former prime minister Anand Panyarachun.
&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace has been at the forefront of investigating and exposing the pollution issues in Map Ta Phut since 2000, and has documented and borne witness to the steady poisoning of the area’s soil, water and air that has led to the current environmental and health disaster at Map Ta Phut,” said Tara Buakamsri, Thailand Country Representative for Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 5px 0px;" src="/seasia/Templates/ReSizes/OriginalWatermarked/PageFiles/148471/20101001_GP_Blockade_MTPIE012_resize.jpg" alt="" width="590"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We support the demands of the local and impacted communities for enforcement of the most stringent legal sanctions to stop the further deterioration of people’s health and Thailand’s environment. Any attempts to dilute national laws to encourage foreign investors for polluting industrial projects will be detrimental to the long term security and well being of Thai people,”&lt;/strong&gt; he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provision 67 of Thailand’s constitution stipulates that any project or activity which may seriously affect the quality of the environment, natural resources and biological diversity shall not be permitted, unless its impacts on the quality of the environment and on health of the people in the communities have been studied and evaluated and consultation with the public and interested parties have been organized, and opinions of an independent organization, consisting of representatives from private environmental and health organizations and from higher education institutions providing studies in the field of environment, natural resources or health, have been obtained prior to the operation of such project or activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the Government of Thailand to Turn The Tide of dirty development and invest in green development for a peaceful future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Adopt national policies to promote sustainable agriculture practices in Thailand by banning genetically-engineered food crops and ending all subsidies to chemical pesticides and fertilizers in Thailand; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement strict measures to protect and stop further deforestation, as well as stop all development projects and policies that are potentially harmful to forest areas and biodiversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior is in Thailand for the first leg of the &lt;strong&gt;“Turn the Tide”&lt;/strong&gt; tour of Southeast Asia.  Greenpeace is calling on ASEAN member nations to support green investments and adopt low-carbon growth pathway for future development.  The Tour marks 10 years of Greenpeace Southeast Asia campaigns to protect forests, catalyze an Energy Revolution, promote sustainable agriculture, and stop water pollution in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

	Singapore- The world’s largest palm oil trader, Wilmar International, has published a detailed action plan to map and monitor all of its suppliers. If implemented, this would put the palm oil giant, which supplies 40% of the world’s palm oil, one step closer to finally eliminating deforestation from its supply chain and would have a major impact on the rest of the industry.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Wilmar supplies palm oil to most of the world’s major food and cosmetics brands. So today’s announcement is a potential breakthrough. If Wilmar keeps its word, by the end of 2019 it will be using satellites to monitor all of its palm oil suppliers, making it almost impossible for them to get away with forest destruction. Greenpeace will be watching closely to make sure Wilmar delivers,” said Kiki Taufik, Global Head of Indonesian Forests Campaign, Greenpeace Southeast Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move follows an intensive global campaign by Greenpeace that aimed to end deforestation for palm oil across the supply chain of the biggest household brands and palm oil buyers in the world. Over 1.3 million people signed a Greenpeace petition calling for an end to deforestation for palm oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past three months, activists&lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/18608/greenpeace-occupies-refinery-loaded-with-dirty-palm-oil-in-indonesia/" target="_blank"&gt; occupied Wilmar’s refinery in Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; and twice&lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/19379/palm-oil-shipment-heading-to-europe-delayed-by-greenpeace-for-over-24-hours/" target="_blank"&gt; boarded a tanker ship&lt;/a&gt; carrying Wilmar's palm oil products. Greenpeace Italy &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/italy/storia/4455/basta-deforestazione-per-lolio-di-palma/" target="_blank"&gt;blockaded the factory&lt;/a&gt; of one of its major customers, Mondelez (owner of Oreo, Cadbury and Ritz). Activists across the world also brought scenes of forest destruction to Mondelez HQs around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is now pausing its campaign to give Wilmar space to put this plan into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forest destruction for commodity production is fuelling a climate and extinction crisis. Scientists warn that keeping global warming below a 1.5ºC rise means ending deforestation and restoring forests. Brands and traders promised to clean up their supply chains by 2020. [1] However, with less than 400 days to go companies are still failing across the board, in part because traders and their customers failed to gather the maps of their suppliers’ plantations needed to monitor what happens on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilmar’s new action plan is designed to address that gap: it commits Wilmar to map its suppliers’ entire landbank by the end of 2019, including concessions from which it does not yet source, and to use high-resolution satellite monitoring to check for deforestation. Companies caught clearing rainforest are to be immediately suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilmar’s announcement puts pressure on the rest of the sector, including other major commodities traders like Golden Agri Resources and Musim Mas that also source palm oil from forest destroyers. Household brands like Mondelez, Nestlé and Unilever, source from many different suppliers and have a responsibility to see equivalent commitments rolled out across the industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“As the world wakes up to the climate and extinction crisis, inaction is not an option. Wilmar has taken an important step and must now put its plan into action immediately. Stopping deforestation requires industry-wide action. Other traders and brands must now follow with credible plans to map and monitor all of their suppliers. Equally important is action to end exploitation and human rights abuses in the palm oil sector,” said Taufik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes to editors: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] In December 2010, members of the Consumer Goods Forum, an industry association comprising 450 of the biggest consumer-facing brands, &lt;a href="https://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/implementing-and-scaling-up-the-cgf-zero-net-deforestation-commitment/" target="_blank"&gt;committed to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains of agricultural commodities&lt;/a&gt; by 2020, including cattle, palm oil, pulp and soya products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2013, Wilmar became the first palm oil trader to adopt a ‘&lt;a href="http://www.wilmar-international.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/No-Deforestation-No-Peat-No-Exploitation-Policy.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;no deforestation, no peat, no exploitation&lt;/a&gt;’ policy that applied to its own plantations and those of its suppliers. By the end of 2014, all major palm oil traders had adopted similar policies. Yet deforestation for palm oil continues because traders and their customers lack the maps needed to monitor what happens on the ground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Campaign timeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, Greenpeace Southeast Asia activists &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/18608/greenpeace-occupies-refinery-loaded-with-dirty-palm-oil-in-indonesia/" target="_blank"&gt;occupied Wilmar’s palm oil refinery&lt;/a&gt; on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi with a rock band and &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/19214/20-artists-present-worldwide-street-art-exhibition-to-end-deforestation-for-palm-oil/" target="_blank"&gt;street artists painted murals&lt;/a&gt; in cities around the world to highlight the threat to birds of paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/19379/palm-oil-shipment-heading-to-europe-delayed-by-greenpeace-for-over-24-hours/" target="_blank"&gt;activists twice boarded and delayed a tanker ship&lt;/a&gt; loaded with Wilmar’s palm oil products. Protests also took place at Mondelez offices in Italy, Germany, the UK and the USA, and &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/19521/the-world-wakes-up-to-oreos-dirty-secret/" target="_blank"&gt;street activities&lt;/a&gt; in 8 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence against Wilmar and Mondelez was documented in a series of reports, including June’s &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/publication/17241/rogue-trader-indonesia-deforestation-wilmar-gama/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rogue Trader&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, September’s &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/publication/18455/the-final-countdown-forests-indonesia-palm-oil/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Countdown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and November’s &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/19292/oreo-maker-linked-to-destruction-of-orangutan-habitat-for-palm-oil-in-indonesia/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dying for a Cookie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has campaigned to end deforestation for palm oil &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/nl/uncategorized/11405/timeline-greenpeace-palm-oil-campaign-2007-2018/" target="_blank"&gt;since 2007&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Palm oil impacts on environment, people and climate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30086-1" target="_blank"&gt;Half of the Bornean orangutan population has been wiped out in just 16 years&lt;/a&gt;, with habitat destruction by the palm oil industry a leading driver. More than three-quarters of Tesso Nilo national park, home to tigers, orangutans and elephants, &lt;a href="http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?264971/Eyes-on-the-Forest-report-Global-supply-chains-still-tainted-with-illegal-palm-oil" target="_blank"&gt;has been converted into illegal palm oil plantations&lt;/a&gt;. Globally, 193 species classified as Critically Endangered, Endangered and Vulnerable, are &lt;a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/palm-oil-and-biodiversity" target="_blank"&gt;threatened by palm oil production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The plantation sector – palm oil and pulp – is the single largest driver of deforestation in Indonesia. Around 24 million hectares of rainforest was destroyed in Indonesia between 1990 and 2015, according to official figures released by the Indonesian government. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deforestation and peatland destruction are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to climate change. This has pushed Indonesia into the &lt;a href="https://www.wri.org/blog/2017/04/interactive-chart-explains-worlds-top-10-emitters-and-how-theyve-changed" target="_blank"&gt;top tier of global emitters, alongside the United States of America and China&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tropical deforestation produces more greenhouse gas emissions each year than the entire European Union; outranking every country except the USA and China. In October 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called for an immediate end to deforestation to limit global temperature rises to 1.5°C.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plantation development is a root cause of Indonesia’s forest and peatland fires. In July 2015, devastating blazes spread in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Papua. These fires produced a haze that affected millions of people across Southeast Asia. Researchers at Harvard and Columbia Universities estimate that the &lt;a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2016/09/smoke-from-2015-indonesian-fires-may-have-caused-100000-premature-deaths" target="_blank"&gt;smoke from 2015 Indonesian fires may have caused 100,000 premature deaths&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/776101467990969768/The-cost-of-fire-an-economic-analysis-of-Indonesia-s-2015-fire-crisis" target="_blank"&gt;The World Bank calculated the cost of the disaster at US$16bn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Palm oil companies are regularly &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/11/palm-oil-global-brands-profiting-from-child-and-forced-labour/" target="_blank"&gt;accused of exploiting workers, children and local communities&lt;/a&gt;. Last month, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil sanctioned two major palm oil companies, &lt;a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-palmoil-fgvholdings/palm-oil-body-says-it-finds-exploitative-labor-practices-at-malaysias-fgv-idUKKCN1NZ18J" target="_blank"&gt;Felda Global Ventures&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ran.org/press-releases/palm-oil-giant-indofood-sanctioned-over-labor-rights-violations/" target="_blank"&gt;Indofood&lt;/a&gt;, following extensive reports of exploitation in their plantations.&lt;/li&gt;

	Samui, Surat Thani,– The Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior, joined a protest-at-sea organized by the Siam Gulf Preservation Network Group off the island of Koh Samui today, to call on the Government of Thailand to abandon its fossil-fuel driven development plans and immediately adopt measures to safeguard marine biodiversity in the Gulf of Thailand and the livelihoods of its coastal communities.

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;The Gulf of Thailand is home to hundreds of coral species as well as endangered whale sharks, dugong, dolphin, sea turtle species.  In the past 35 or so years, more than 5,000 offshore oil wells have been drilled in its waters.&lt;/strong&gt;  At the same time, experts have noted the steady decline of quality in the country’s most important marine waters, as well as relentless industrial encroachment on valuable marine ecosystems. However, the government continues to approve the increased entry of heavy industries, even as pollution and environmental impacts remain only minimally addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Thai government’s unchecked race toward industrialization favors dirty development and victimizes resources essential for economic sustainability. Oil drilling projects in the Gulf are a shameful example of how time and again, people’s livelihoods and health, and our natural biodiversity on which these depend, are sacrificed for short term prosperity that benefits only a very small sector of society. We are demanding cancellation of all new permits granted to petroleum companies currently conducting oil exploration and drilling off Koh Samui, Koh Phangan and Koh Tao in the Gulf of Thailand” said Samui Mayor Ramnet Jaikwang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ancient forests are being wiped out, oceans are plundered to the point of no return, agricultural biodiversity is in meltdown from modern industrial farming, and the impacts of climate change are causing irreversible damage to the planet and threaten food security for millions of people.  The results of the 3rd Global Biodiversity Outlook confirm that the Earth has reached crucial tipping points for a number of ecosystems -- such as coral reefs and forests.  Unless strong action is taken, many ecosystems will no longer be able to sustain life and provide for the needs of present and future generations.  Greenpeace believes governments should seize the occasion of the Convention on Biological Diversity COP 10 in Nagoya to make agreements that ensure real action is taken to protect Life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Greenpeace is here supporting community movements in order to catalyze Thai society to make green development a reality.  Change is possible.  Ten years ago, the Rainbow Warrior visited Samui to address the issue of waste management and dioxin pollution.  With growing global concern over biodiversity loss, climate change, and the negative impacts of coal and nuclear energy, communities in places such as Sichon, Tong Ching, and Samui, here in Thailand’s southern seaboard are standing up to carve their own sustainable development plans,” &lt;/strong&gt;Said Tara Buakamsri, Greenpeace Country Representative for Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior is in Thailand for the first leg of the &lt;strong&gt;“Turn the Tide” &lt;/strong&gt;tour of Southeast Asia.  Greenpeace is calling on ASEAN member nations to support green investments and adopt low-carbon growth pathway for future development.  The Tour marks 10 years of Greenpeace Southeast Asia campaigns to protect forests, catalyze an Energy Revolution, promote sustainable agriculture, and stop water pollution in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta - Greenpeace today called on the Indonesian government to Turn the Tide of converging environmental and humanitarian crises by adopting a green development pathway to address the impacts of climate change and to help the country progress and prosper without damaging its rich natural heritage. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The environment group made the call as they announced the visit of the Rainbow Warrior to Indonesia.  The ship is in the region for the “Turn the Tide tour of Southeast Asia” and is set to dock on Wednesday, October 14, at Jakarta’s Tanjung Priok port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/PageFiles/101571/images/forest-beauty-klmantan.jpg" alt="Hutan Indonesia" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Turn the Tide Tour of the Rainbow Warrior brings a message of hope and is a call to action for all ASEAN governments.  Southeast Asia is one of the most vulnerable and least prepared regions to cope with the impacts of climate change.  But the solutions are in our hands.  Indonesia is leading the region and the world in commitments to reduce climate causing carbon emissions. The next step is to ensure our country follows a green and sustainable pathway for development for the sake of future generations,” Said Nur Hidayati , Indonesia Country Representative of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stopping deforestation is the quickest and the most effective way to reduce global carbon emissions while ensuring the safety and future of thousands of species including millions of people in our country, the region, and the world.  Together with a massive uptake of renewable energy combined with energy efficiency measures, Indonesia can leapfrog ahead of other developing nations in meeting development and energy demands with little or no negative impact on climate and local communities,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/PageFiles/101571/images/rainbow-warrior.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="372"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior arrives in Indonesia after three weeks of working  with grassroots environmental movements in Thailand.  Greenpeace joined  communities in Thai provinces in their call for renewable energy  solutions and their demand for a model of development that values human  lives and livelihoods, as well as the natural ecosystems on which these  depend.  The Tour marks 10 years of Greenpeace Southeast Asia campaigns  to protect forests, catalyze an Energy Revolution, promote sustainable  agriculture, and stop water pollution in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is home to the world’s third largest tropical forest and  ranks second in the world in terms of biodiversity and number of endemic  species.  Experts recognize that the country’s forests are a key to  stabilizing the world’s climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior’s  two-and-a-half month voyage across Southeast  Asia to promote a green and peaceful future began in Thailand on  September 17, 2010 and will conclude in the Philippines on November 30.  The ship’s fourth visit to the region coincides with the 10th year  anniversary of Greenpeace’s official presence in Southeast Asia — as  well as the Rainbow Warrior’s first ever tour of the region, the  ‘Toxics-Free Asia Tour’ in 2000.

	Bangkok, 12 Oct 2010-- Greenpeace today released a report entitled “Thai Rice Industry at Risk: The costs of a possible GE contamination of Thai rice” which shows that should GE rice contamination occur in Thailand, the country’s rice industry could face export losses of up to 96,327 million Baht (€2,031 million) or 56% of the value of Thai rice exports in 2009. The report was released ahead of the TRT World Rice Conference in Pukhet, Thailand.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace  is calling on the Thai government to secure its rice economy by immediately  announcing a ban on lab tests and field trials of genetically engineered (GE)  rice. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “The  outcomes of this report indicate that the Thai government needs to be extremely  diligent in protecting its rice supply from GE contamination. If GE rice were  to contaminate the Thai rice supply, the Thai government and rice industry  would have to engage in a series of costly actions to ensure that the GE  contamination is cleared from the rice merchandising system. These would  include seed testing protocols, certified seed sampling, crop producer  certifications, establishment of a task force to educate rice producers and a  moratorium on GE seeds,” said Natwipha Ewasakul, Sustainable Agriculture  Campaigner for Greenpeace Southeast Asia. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Despite the  LL601 rice contamination event in the USA in 2006 that caused damage of  up to 48,587 million baht (€1,024 million) to American farmers and rice  industry, giant agro-chemical industries continue to push for the approval of  GE rice globally. This leaves open a distinct possibility that more  contamination events could occur. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Thailand is the largest rice exporter in the  world. Greenpeace commissioned the report to highlight the possible economic  effects that a case of GE contamination would have on the Thai rice industry.  The study uses the LL601 rice contamination event in the US in 2006, and  other well-known unintended GE releases as a reference.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; According  to the report, the most likely scenario, based on the US LL601 contamination  experience, would result in short- and long-term reduction of Thai rice  exports, testing and segregation of merchandising/processing systems. This  could mean total economic losses and costs totaling as much as 96,327 million  Baht (€2,031 million). While this amount takes into account export losses over  four years, it is the equivalent of 56% of the value of Thai rice export in  2009. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “Rice is  the single most important food crop in Southeast Asia.  The introduction of GE rice in Thailand  and in Southeast Asia will destroy both Thailand’s rice trade and  agriculture. Thailand  should immediately ban any GE rice in the country, including field trials, rice  from import and of course, cultivation.

	Cirebon – This morning, a flotilla of more than 30 fishing boats set off from the village of Waruduwur towards Cirebon coal-fired power plant. Onboard, local fishermen and Greenpeace activists called on Indonesia's government to abandon its plans to build more coal plants, and to embrace a clean energy revolution instead.

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;The fishermen of Waruduwur know all about the grim realities of coal. Since the Cirebon plant was built on their doorstep, fish stocks in the coastal waters around the village have plummeted.
&lt;p&gt;“Three years ago we easily found crab and shrimp in coastal area,” says Mr Romansah, a Waruduwur fisherman. “But since the construction of the coal plant, we can now only catch five shrimps for one day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fishing isn't the only livelihood to have suffered. Traditional salt makers' land has been cut off, and they can no longer make salt. In nearby villages, terasi (shrimp paste) makers and green mussels catchers have all been badly affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Queen of Cirebon spoke out in support of Greenpeace's activities today, saying that she welcomed any organisation – including Greenpeace – that worked for environmental protection and the welfare of Indonesia's people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;Later, in the village, Greenpeace launched &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/news/publications/batubara-mematikan/"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt; exploring the real price of coal for Indonesia. Across the country, Indonesians living near coal mines and coal fired power plants are experiencing the real price of coal: toxic pollution, destroyed livelihoods, displaced communities, health impacts, acid rain, smog pollution, and reduced agricultural yields.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the government pursues its plan to build more coal plants, it's not just bad news for communities near the plants; burning coal releases greenhouse gases, and all Indonesians will feel the effects of climate change. Meanwhile, Indonesia's abundant solar, wind and geo-thermal potential goes mostly unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia doesn’t need more coal. To help to ensure a better future for all of our children and grand-children, it needs an energy revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re one of the 100,000 donors who bought a bolt, an action boat, an anchor, a chart, a soap dish, a piece of her sail or the whole of her wheelhouse, thank you. If you’re one of our 3 million regular annual donors, merci bien. If you’re one of our 17 million email or mobile subscribers, Facebook fans or Twitter followers, gracias. If you’re one of our 14,000 volunteers, danke schön.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We said the Earth needed a new warrior, and each of you answered that call: today we smash a bottle of champagne across the bow, and launch the world’s first ship built from the keel up to win the battle for the future of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two A-frame masts exclaim that this is no ordinary sailing ship: it is a sleek, efficient eco-vessel, every detail crafted with sustainability in mind, from the silicon-based paint on her hull to the FSC wood of her cabins, to the onboard recycling systems and biological sewage treatment. The new Rainbow Warrior will primarily be powered and propelled by the sun and wind , with the option in unsuitable weather to switch to efficient diesel-electric power. The revolutionary mast design allows her to carry more sail, and makes room for the radio masts, antennas, and domes that provide internet and satellite communications -- allowing us to broadcast video from remote locations and tweet from any ocean. She boasts a video editing suite, a theatre, a campaign office, two fast action boats, webcams fore and aft and a helicopter hanger and helideck. She can accommodate up to 30 people.&lt;/p&gt;

            Melina Laboucan-Massimo is from the Cree First Nation from Northern Alberta, Canada. She is the Godmother of the ship.

&lt;p&gt;The first ship to bear her name was a rusting fishing trawler scraped and sanded down by hand and painted with a dove and rainbow. She made history saving whales, stopping radioactive waste dumping, and sailing straight into the forbidden zone around nuclear weapons tests from the Pacific to the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her voyage into history was cut short by two limpet mines in 1985, when frightened politicians in Paris ordered French agents to sink the ship in New Zealand, believing this would stop our protests against nuclear weapons tests. One crewmember was murdered in the attack – photographer Fernando Pereira. It was a massive miscalculation, catalyzing opposition throughout the Pacific, strengthening Greenpeace, and hardening our resolve to rebuild and return. A supporter in Auckland coined the phrase that became a motto of opposition: “You Can’t Sink a Rainbow.”  When we returned to Moruroa in a refurbished sister ship, the legacy of the Rainbow Warrior as a parable of persistence was sealed. Today the Rainbow Warrior II is doing relief work in India as a hospital ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a purpose-built campaigning ship, the new Warrior will be a voice for our oceans, our forests, our climate, and our future. Built to last for at least 50 years, she is a promise to you, our supporters, to never give in, never give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi Naidoo, Greenpeace International Executive Director, said at the ceremony: “The new Rainbow Warrior is the perfect ship with which navigate the perfect storm of ecological, economic and democratic crises lashing our world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Carrying an international crew, the Rainbow Warrior will confront environmental criminals across the world, she will investigate and expose destructive activities, but perhaps most of all will provide a beacon of hope and an inspiration to action wherever she goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’ve not yet been a part of the journey of building the Rainbow Warrior, please come onboard and be part of her voyage. The world needs another warrior: you.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Southeast Asian climate activists wearing winter jackets, rain gear and beach wear to portray climate chaos that is wreaking havoc across the region, met Christiana Figueres,  Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at the gates of the United Nations Convention Center in Bangkok today, to demand an ambitious global climate deal from world governments on behalf of the region’s most vulnerable and least prepared populations.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 4px;" src="/seasia/PageFiles/287379/afab-asean%20(1).JPG" alt="" width="300"&gt;The activity was organized by A-FAB , ASEAN for a Fair, Ambitious and Binding Climate Deal, a regional coalition composed of Greenpeace, Oxfam and WWF, who are calling upon leaders of Association of Southeast Asian Nations to take a higher ground in the latest rounds of UN climate negotiations that began in Bangkok today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are sending a message to all delegates, especially ASEAN delegates, that a fair, ambitious, and binding global deal is a matter of survival for the people of Southeast Asia.  This week, governments meet to take forward agreed objectives from the UN climate talks in Cancun last December.  They will talk about adaptation, climate finance, mitigation and technology transfer mechanisms.  In the interests of the region it is crucial that we hear one strong voice from ASEAN, moving the regional body to a higher ground in responding to the real and urgent challenges of climate change,” said Zelda Soriano, Policy Advisor, Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few weeks, Thailand’s capital has been thrown into confusion by below 20°C temperatures in the middle of summer, even as a spate of floods and landslides last week in southern Thailand have impacted almost two million people.  Just this month, similar disasters in different parts of central and southern Philippines have devastated the livelihood of tens of thousands. Flooding has also forced the mass evacuation of thousands in Indonesia.  During the last UN climate meeting in Bangkok in 2009, twin typhoons in the Philippines saw 80 percent of its capital Manila under water, and in the end, leaving almost a thousand dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indeed, in Southeast Asia in particular, climate change is not a debate but a grim reality.  Our region is repeatedly assailed by an endless refrain of floods, landslides and drought.  In fact, this UN climate meeting in Bangkok happens as parts of Southeast Asia are once again reeling from extreme climate events.  The stakes are high in our region.  ASEAN delegates must therefore ensure that the adaptation gets much of the resources as it is more urgently needed, and must demand much deeper emissions cuts from developed countries,” said Shalimar Vitan, East Asia Regional Policy and Campaigns Coordinator, Oxfam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A-FAB is forwarding policy recommendations for ASEAN in the Bangkok intersessional. Among these is the assurance that the newly created Adaptation Committee consists primarily of developing countries, follows a country-driven and gender-sensitive approach in the development of national adaptation policies and programs, and is linked to financing mechanisms. ASEAN must ensure that adaptation gets much of the resources from the new Green Climate Fund established in Cancun, as it is more urgently needed by the majority of the poor population,” said Sandeep Chamling Rai of WWF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A-FAB likewise urges ASEAN to push for the peaking of global emissions by 2015 and to demand at least a 40 percent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction by developed countries by 2020, and at least a 95 percent cut below 1990 levels by 2050.  Another task is to decide on the most accurate and appropriate measurable, reportable and verifiable (MRV) instruments in ascertaining GHG emissions reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set up by the coalition of Greenpeace, Oxfam and WWF, ASEAN for a Fair, Ambitious and Binding Global Climate Deal (A-FAB) aims to sharpen and strengthen ASEAN’s position as a regional bloc at the UNFCCC and as a community that collectively struggles to avert the impacts of climate change. Moreover, it intends to complement ASEAN’s attempts at ensuring the participation of its “community in the global community,” following the increasing processes which put its Charter at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;The ‘Turn the Tide’ tour coincides with the 10th year anniversary of Greenpeace’s official presence in Southeast Asia — as well as the Rainbow Warrior’s first ever tour of the region, the ‘Toxics-Free Asia Tour’ in 2000, which inaugurated Greenpeace Southeast Asia in 2000.
&lt;p&gt;Over the past 10 years Greenpeace has documented a dramatic increase in the level of toxic substances detected in water samples taken from the country’s many canals, rivers and coastal areas, and air samples around industrial estates.  The increasing reports of health problems among local population due to direct exposure to industrial toxic effluents and emissions from places such as Mae-Moh in the northern hills to Map Tha Phut in the Gulf of Thailand are early signs of a humanitarian crisis in the making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ongoing debate in Thailand to strengthen pollution control measures highlights the importance of moving away from the business as usual approach which has resulted in dramatic losses to the environment and significant health problems for host communities. The Thai government has a real opportunity here to lay the foundation for a greener economy," said Von Hernandez, Executive Director of  Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With meaningful public participation, this process could strategically liberate the country from the  treadmill of destructive, carbon intensive and fossil-fuel based systems which have given rise to the most urgent environmental threats the world faces today. Even as the government is looking at ways to stimulate the economy, it is critical that such economic interventions are also sustainable for the planet and especially for Thailand’s future. “  he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior’s ‘Turn the Tide’ tour will demonstrate and promote right solutions and expose and confront wrong practices in global efforts to tackle climate change.  In Thailand the ship will participate in solidarity activities with local communities, people’s movements, and partner ngos to promote a common vision of green development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Rainbow Warrior is a symbol of positive change and represents people’s struggle for a cleaner, greener and peaceful future.  This is her fifth visit to Thailand in the last ten years, and we have been impressed by the growing awareness and opposition by the people of Thailand to dirty development.  We are looking forward to participate in activities being organized by communities in Nakhon Si Thamarrat, Surathani, Koh Samui, Chumphon and  Prachuab Kirikhan as they build the momentum to realize a new vision.  Business as usual is not an option.” said Derek Nicholls, Captain of the Rainbow Warrior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling upon the Government of Thailand to Turn The Tide of dirty development and invest in green development for a peaceful future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies by ending all subsidies to fossil-fuels, nuclear projects and energy-intensive industries in Thailand;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean up Chao Phraya river with clear timelines to reduce, restrict and ultimately eliminate discharges of toxic chemicals in all water sources of Thailand;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adopt national policies to promote sustainable agriculture practices in Thailand by banning genetically-engineered food crops and ending all subsidies to chemical pesticides and fertilizers in Thailand; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement strict measures to protect and stop further deforestation, as well as stop all development projects and policies that are potentially harm to forest areas and biodiversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior is in Thailand for the first leg of the “Turn the Tide” tour of Southeast Asia.  Greenpeace is calling on ASEAN member nations to support green investments and adopt low-carbon growth pathway for future development.  The Tour marks 10 years of Greenpeace Southeast Asia campaigns to protect forests, catalyze an Energy Revolution, promote sustainable agriculture, and stop water pollution in the region. &lt;/p&gt;

	Cirebon – Greenpeace today called on the Indonesian government to abandon its plans to build more coal fired power plants and instead embrace a clean energy future powered by renewable energy, at the launch of a report “Batubara mematikan: The high price of cheap coal, how Indonesians are paying the price for the world’s dirtiest fuel.”
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 4px;" src="/seasia/PageFiles/101499/images/Cirebon%20Coal%20Power%20Plant.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="191"&gt;On the occasion, fishermen from Waruduwur village and Greenpeace activists covered in black “coal” powder, displayed a banner with the words “coal kills” in a fishing boat in front of the Cirebon coal fired power plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/news/publications/batubara-mematikan/" target="_self"&gt;Report Batubara Mematikan &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air pollution from coal combustion is destroying livelihoods, reducing crop yields, adversely impacting fishing catch and slowly killing people. Coal is a curse for communities living around coal mines and in the shadow of coal fired power plants. Burning coal also accelerates climate change which will impact the whole country. Indonesia is amongst the world’s most vulnerable and least prepared to deal with climate change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report contains testimonials about how coal mines and power plants drastically affect the health and livelihoods of people living near them. The stories expose the grim consequences of coal expansion – toxic pollution, destroyed livelihoods, displaced communities, health effects on the respiratory and nervous systems, acid rain, smog pollution, and reduced agricultural yields – that governments and industries ignore in the quest for “cheap” electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal may seem like the most practical fuel because of its abundance. But, from mining, through combustion to waste disposal, and in some cases, recultivation, coal has a dire impact on the environment, human health and the social fabric of communities living near mines, plants and waste sites. Aside from massive CO2 emissions when this fuel is burnt, coal severely damages ecosystems and contaminates water supplies. It emits other greenhouse gases like methane, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, as well as chemicals such as arsenic and mercury which can disrupt human mental and physical development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is the world’s fifth biggest coal producer and its second largest exporter. Stark evidence of the serious consequences of coal use are clearly seen in some of the country’s coal provinces. Coal mining has caused severe damage to the traditional way of life and the capital city of Kalimantan, Samarinda, with coal concessions occupying 70% of its land area. Coal mines are situated right beside villages, and coal waste from abandoned mines dot the city with toxic lakes. In Cirebon and Cilacap, coal-fired power plants have left communities without livelihoods, and ongoing coal plant operations continue to endanger their health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, Indonesia’s plans to increase electricity generation from coal to about 34.4% by 2025. Plans are underway to reduce oil use and shift to coal and gas, with a target of 10,000 MW from coal. But although the initial program was supposed to be achieved in 2009 with the completion of 35 coal powered plants — ten on the island of Java, and the rest in other parts of the country – less than 60% of the target has been completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;It’s not too late! Indonesia doesn’t need more coal, it needs an energy revolution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renewable energy combined with energy efficiency can cut CO2 emissions as per President Yudhoyono’s commitment to reduce Indonesia’s greenhouse gas emissions. Indonesia has abundant solar, wind and geo-thermal power to meets its energy requirements. If the Indonesian government abandons its dirty energy plans, it can meet over 40 percent of primary energy demand through these renewable sources. This will not only halt further human and societal damage, as well as ecological degradation and devastating climate change impacts. It will also be an important contribution for the future of our children and grand-children’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

	Around 100 Greenpeace activists and supporters held a candlelight vigil at Bundaran HI in Jakarta today to express solidarity with victims of the earthquake, tsunami and the unfolding nuclear disaster at the Fukushima/Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Our thoughts are with the people of Japan who in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami are now faced with a dreadful situation, where instead of being able to plough all resources into rescue and relief efforts, the government is dealing with a crisis caused by the inherent and inescapable risks of nuclear power,” said Nur Hidayati, - Indonesia Country Representative, Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese authorities are fully aware that high levels of radiation from the Fukushima/Daiichi nuclear plant have spread far beyond the official evacuation zone, yet are still not taking action to properly protect people or keep them informed them about the risks to their health. (1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace radiation experts monitoring the situation on the ground in Japan have confirmed radiation levels of up to ten microsieverts per hour in Iitate village, 40km northwest of the crisis-stricken Fukushima/Daiichi nuclear plant, and 20km beyond the official evacuation zone. These levels are high enough to require evacuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team measured radiation of between 7 and 10 microsieverts per hour in Iitate, on Sunday March 27th. (2) The levels detected refer to external radiation, and do not take into account the further risks such of ingestion or inhalation. The annual limit for accumulated dose for members of the public is 1000 microsieverts. The current official evacuation zone is 20km around Fukushima, while people living between 20km and 30km from the plant have been advised to stay indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This nuclear crisis is a man-made disaster, the impacts of which will be long felt even after the Japanese people have recovered and rebuilt their lives from the natural disasters of earthquake and tsunami.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Reverberations from the Fukushima crisis are being felt around the world, as plans to build new nuclear power plants are being challenged. The safety of existing plants is being questioned.” Said Arif Fiyanto, Greenpeace Southeast Asia energy campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is time for the nuclear industry to come clean on the true dangers of nuclear power and stop spreading their lies to countries like Indonesia, and other ASEAN countries.  The smartest move for Indonesia and governments around the world is to heavily invest in energy efficiency, and redouble their efforts to harness safe and secure renewable energy sources,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace and the European Renewable Energy Council have developed an energy scenario which delivers the world's energy supply with 95% renewable energy by 2050: reliable energy with more jobs, more equitable power distribution, and no "peak solar" or "peak wind" fuel price variations. In this scenario, an ambitious energy efficiency program along with massive development of renewable energy happen in parallel, so that by 2050, the global energy system is 95% powered by renewable energy. Energy will move towards a decentralised system using local renewable sources such as wind, solar and geothermal. (3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) The Fukushima Prefectural Government has been measuring the radiation levels in Iitate and confirming consistent and even higher range of radiation levels during the past two weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• on March  27 they found levels 8.2 uSv/h&lt;br&gt;• on March 15 they found 44.7 uSv/h&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) The team measured radiation of between 7 and 10 microsievert per hour in the town of Iitate, on Sunday March 27th. The levels detected refer to external radiation, and do not take into account the further risks such of ingestion or inhalation.

	Greenpeace activists dressed as endangered species of Indonesian forests, together with a coalition of Indonesian NGOs, today went to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to call for the immediate implementation of moratorium on forest destruction that can successfully protect vital rainforest, as well as Indonesia’s biodiversity, people and economy which depend on it. on forest destruction.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Sustainability and economic development go hand in hand.  Ensuring sustainable development will avert further ecological degradation. And a good moratorium is key toward real and lasting development that will improve the welfare of all Indonesians.  The Ministry of Economic Affairs must realise that it has a stake in the success of a good moratorium, and in its function to coordinate economic policy, it should work to push the government toward a greener and fairer economy,” said Yuyun Indradi, Greenpeace Southeast Asia Forests Political Campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moratorium on forest destruction was supposed to have been implemented on 1 January 2011.  But after three months, the moratorium still remains to be finalized.  Many believe that the three-month delay is related to intervention from industry interests,  and that no delay would happen if all government departments are together in a strong commitment to save and protect Indonesia’s forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace together with a broad coalition of NGOs in Indonesia is calling on the President to issue a moratorium that is not time-bound, which protects all natural forests and peatlands, including secondary forests.  It should apply to areas within existing concessions and those areas granted in principle to industry on 31 December 2010.  &lt;a href="http://image.greenpeace.or.id/peta-hutan/indicativemoratorium_CSOplatform_map.jpg"&gt;Last month, Greenpeace revealed maps that show how the proposed draft ‘moratorium’ which was being considered by the government was inadequate and would fail to protect the crucial forest areas.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During today’s activity, the “endangered animals” handed to the ministry recommendations which define a ‘good moratorium.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We support President SBY’s commitment to implement a moratorium on deforestation. The moratorium is an important first step to a long term scheme to improve Indonesia’s forests governance, particularly in forest-related sectors such as forestry, plantations and mining.  But the forests cannot wait.  Any delay in the implementation of a good moratorium means forests continue to be bulldozed day after day.   Data from the Ministry of Forestry states the rate of forest destruction in Indonesia is 1,1 million hectares per year.  This means that the three month delay in the moratorium implementation has already resulted in deforestation of approximately 275,000 hectares, equivalent to four times the land area of ​​Jakarta," said Mansuetus Darto, National Coordinator Palm Oil Farmers Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono pledged that Indonesia will undertake a bold commitment to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, and announced a target to reduce emissions by 26% by 2020 compared to business as usual and by up to 41% with international support.  Greenpeace and Indonesian civil society agree that this target can be achieved with a good moratorium if implementation is backed by strong law enforcement, and accommodates rights of local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

	The A-FAB coalition today urged ASEAN countries to show leadership and advance a strong common position in the international climate change talks for the sake of the region’s people.  A-FAB, or the Coalition on ASEAN for a Fair, Ambitious and Binding Climate Deal, composed of Greenpeace, Oxfam and WWF, made the call in Bangkok on the eve of the United Nations climate talks due to be held next week in the Thai capital.  
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 3px;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/ReSizes/ImageGalleryLarge/Global/seasia/20101112-TH-ASEAN04a.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="189"&gt;The group believes that the ASEAN’s practical and political stakes in the climate negotiations are high.  Southeast Asian countries, with their extensive and populated coastlines and location within the so-called “ring of fire,” are considered among the most vulnerable to climate change and disasters.  Although the region is teeming with natural resources, especially marine life and forests, it is also a region that is for the most part marred by chronic poverty and even conflict.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A-FAB believes that the ASEAN as a group must take the climate negotiations more seriously by presenting a strong and unified negotiating voice.  The current reality demands closer collaboration and stronger mandates that will enable the ASEAN to push harder for a fair, ambitious and binding climate deal on which the region’s survival depends.  In Bangkok, the  ASEAN must now accelerate its processes and positions as the finer details of the Cancun Agreements are discussed and resistance from developed countries is mounting,” said Atty. Zelda Soriano, Policy Advisor, Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During COP 16 in Cancun, Mexico, ASEAN demonstrated a modest show of force as then chair, Vietnam, reaffirmed the body’s commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and called for “comprehensive, effective and binding outcomes,” that accounts for a “common but differentiated responsibilities.”  Prior to this, ASEAN created an ASEAN Working Group on Climate Change (AWGCC) that in turn formed the ASEAN Climate Change Initiative (ACCI), a regional consultative platform.  But at present, the ACCI lacks the mandate to successfully achieve its objective, that is, to sharpen and consolidate ASEAN’s position at the UNFCCC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A-FAB is therefore additionally calling on ASEAN to convene a high-level meeting that will strengthen the mandate of AWGCC and ACCI and in the process facilitate the participation of broader communities in the climate negotiations.  Should it push through, the high-level meeting will happen at an opportune time as the first intersessional is being hosted by Thailand, an ASEAN member state.  Moreover, ASEAN’s current chair, Indonesia carries the theme “ASEAN community in the global community” which implies a more active diplomacy and a more consultative participation in international governance processes such as the UNFCCC. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The establishment of the A-FAB shows that there is an emerging ASEAN constituency that is concerned about the decisions and steps undertaken by the ASEAN to address climate change.  This calls for greater openness for ASEAN, the regional body, to be more engaging and accountable to the regional communities that are gravely affected by climate change and the threats it represents.  We see active engagement as ASEAN’s way of keeping its commitments under its newly-adopted Charter, which in the first place was created to ensure the responsiveness of the regional bloc to its communities, and in this context, taking a higher ground in responding to the threats of climate change,” said Shalimar Vitan, East Asia Regional Policy and Campaigns Coordinator, Oxfam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AFAB is forwarding some policy recommendations for ASEAN in the Bangkok intersessional. Among these is the assurance that the newly created Adaptation Committee consists primarily of developing countries, follows a country-driven and gender-sensitive approach in the development of national adaptation policies and programs, and is linked to financing mechanisms. ASEAN must ensure that adaptation gets much of the resources from the new Green Climate Fund established in Cancun, as it is more urgently needed by the majority of the poor population. A-FAB likewise urges ASEAN to push for the peaking of global emissions by 2015 and to demand a 25 to 40 percent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction by developed countries by 2020, and at least a 95 percent cut below 1990 levels by 2050.  Another task is to decide on the most accurate and appropriate measurable, reportable and verifiable (MRV) instruments in ascertaining GHG emissions reduction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set up by the coalition of Greenpeace, Oxfam and WWF, ASEAN for a Fair, Ambitious and Binding Global Climate Deal (A-FAB) aims to sharpen and strengthen ASEAN’s position as a regional bloc at the UNFCCC and as a community that collectively struggles to avert the impacts of climate change. Moreover, it intends to complement ASEAN’s attempts at ensuring the participation of its “community in the global community,” following the increasing processes which put its Charter at work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A-FAB Briefing &lt;a href="/seasia/PageFiles/286792/AFAB-Briefing-31mar2011.pdf"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more information:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Word that the Rainbow Warrior would visit Jakarta had spread far and wide. People across Java had responded enthusiastically saying they wanted to tour the famous ship over the weekend and had made plans to bring their families and friends.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Then news came that the Indonesian Government - without stating their grounds  - would not allow the Rainbow Warrior into Indonesian waters.  The ship remained outside of Indonesia, waiting to be granted permission to enter. &lt;a href="http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/civil-society-coalition-pushes-government-to-finally-halt-logging-permits/401438"&gt;Meanwhile House of Representatives deputy speaker Pramono Anung&lt;/a&gt; has been reported saying that blocking the Rainbow Warrior's entry to Indonesia was damaging the country’s reputation internationally because the Rainbow Warrior was coming to fight climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace staff did all they could do to contact the hundreds of Greenpeace supporters who had planned to visit the historic ship and meet the crew. But there was always the chance people hadn’t heard and would come to the wharf. A venue was set up at the wharf with a view of the empty dock where the Rainbow Warrior should have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room was decorated with beautiful images of Indonesian rainforests  and the destruction caused by conversion to palm plantations. And a 2  metre high model of the Rainbow Warrior III was put on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Little Warriors Come&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day that could have been sad turned quickly into celebration. The first guests brought an archway of colourful balloons. Parents of a little boy, Dava, who are Greenpeace supporters, had organised his fourth birthday around a tour of the Rainbow Warrior. The room filled with laughing excited children, happy parents and other Greenpeace supporters. A birthday cake in the shape of a tropical island arrived covered with the animal stars from the film Madagascar: a zebra, lion, giraffe, hippopotamus and lots of cheeky penguins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An internet link beamed crew of the Rainbow Warrior who were floating just outside Indonesian waters onto a screen. The crew had made a banner reading: “Apa Kabar? Semoga kita bertemu segera” [How are you? Hopefully we will meet soon]. The children held up signs to the crew that said “Keep your spirits up” and “We love the Rainbow Warrior”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a magic show, live music, and a guest appearance by Spiderman, Greenpeace campaigner Hindun talked to the children about the special animals of Indonesia, orangutan, elephant and Sumatran tiger. “Save the Forests!” the children yelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two women had flown from Surabaya to see the Rainbow Warrior. Their words expressed what we had heard from a variety of people during the week.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Greenpeace Energy [R]evolution is a detailed, practical blueprint for cutting carbon emissions while achieving economic growth by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;This phase-out of fossil fuels offers substantial benefits such as energy security, independence from world market fuel prices, reduction in pollution-related illnesses and most of all, it is an urgently needed solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to halt runaway climate change phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

	The latest edition of the Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics (1) shows significant separation between companies that are failing to keep their environmental commitments and those that are making significant gains in phasing out toxic chemicals, increasing energy efficiency, and making it easier for consumers to recycle older products.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace applauds Philips for releasing the first TV free of PVC and brominated flame retardants (BFRs). The Econova TV puts Philips on track to meet its commitment to phase out these hazardous substances by the end the year, well ahead of other TV manufacturers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“There is a growing gulf between companies that are consistently innovating and leading by releasing greener products and companies that just make big promises,” said Casey Harrell toxics campaigner from US. “By launching a PVC- and BFR-free TV, Philips has overcome the technical hurdles to removing these toxic substances from this product group – there is now no excuse for other TV manufacturers not to follow.“ &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New products free of PVC and BFRs (2) have been put on the shelves by Acer, the Indian companies Wipro and HCL, and HP, which now has several lines of notebooks, desktops and most recently a PVC-free printer. In contrast, Toshiba, LGE, Samsung, Dell and Lenovo still have no whole PC product lines free from these substances.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toshiba is served a second penalty point this year for misleading its customers about its commitments and a first penalty point is imposed on Microsoft for backtracking on commitments to remove these toxic substances. Several other companies continue to be weighed down by penalty points for failing to meet their phase out commitments, including LGE, Samsung, Dell and Lenovo (3).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nokia and Sony Ericsson remain well ahead in 1st and 2nd place for producing products free of the most hazardous substances, including PVC/BFRs, antimony, beryllium, and phthlates. HP, Samsung and Lenovo are the biggest climbers in this edition. Samsung climbs to 5th place from 13th, despite retaining a penalty points for backtracking on its commitment to eliminate PVC and BFRs.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple takes the biggest drop, not because it has lost any points but because several other companies have overtaken it. LGE and Toshiba, both previously amongst the leaders, now take 14th and 16th place, showing that in this fast moving and innovative  sector that standing still is just not good enough&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although scores on Waste and Recycling show the least progress overall, Panasonic is rewarded for initiating voluntary take-back and recycling of its TVs in India, the first programme of its kind for TVs outside the OECD and another first for TVs. However, the industry as a whole is failing to expand current take-back programmes to achieve global reach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Panasonic is stepping up to the challenge of taking responsibility for its end-of-life TVs – but further company initiatives to take-back and recycle e-waste outside the rich world are desperately needed; Panasonic’s programme could jump start this process”  said Casey Harrell “These encouraging developments on both greener products and e-waste are welcome; its unfortunate that they also highlight the lack of ambition of those that lag behind.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. The full Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics can be found at www.greenpeace.org/electronics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Some brominated flame retardants (BFRs), used in circuit boards and plastic casings, do not break down easily and build up in the environment.  Long-term exposure can lead to impaired learning and memory functions. They can also interfere with thyroid and oestrogen hormone systems and exposure in the womb has been linked to behavioural problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a plastic used in some electronics products and for insulation on wires and cables. Chlorinated dioxins and furans are released when PVC is produced or disposed of by incineration (or simply burning). These chemicals are highly persistent in the environment and many are toxic even in very low concentrations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Toshiba, Samsung, LGE, Dell and Lenovo continue to be penalised in this latest version of the Guide for backtracking on their commitments to phase out PVC and BFRs. Toshiba is served with a further penalty point for misleading its customers and Greenpeace by not admitting that it would not meet its commitment.  In addition, Microsoft is served with a penalty point for the first time for backtracking on its commitment to phase out PVC and BFRs by the end of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

	So called ‘golden’ rice will not help in the fight against vitamin A deficiency (VAD) according to a report released by Greenpeace at the International Rice Congress today. The report documents successful measures taken to minimise the impact of VAD globally and details the history of ‘golden’ rice and the funding that has been assigned to it which could have been used to intensify efforts to eradicate VAD using the tools currently in use.
&lt;div&gt;

Not only has it failed to have any impact on VAD while using money and resources that could have been given to real solutions, it is also environmentally irresponsible. Genetically Engineered (GE) crops have contaminated, and will continue to contaminate neighbouring crops wherever they are released.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Releasing GE rice in Asia could irreversibly affect traditional rice varieties and wild ancestors of rice, decreasing our ability to use these valuable genetic resources in the future. It will also impact rice culture” said Dr. Janet Cotter, Senior Scientist at Greenpeace Research Laboratories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vitamin A uptake in the body requires more than merely the presence of pro-vitamin A compounds (present in ‘golden’ rice) in the diet – fat, for example, is required to convert pro-vitamin A to vitamin A which the body can use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In contrast to ‘golden’ rice, other methods have already been used in successful programs to tackle VAD throughout the world. Dietary diversification addresses multiple deficiencies and in the case of home gardens, empowers people to diversify their own diet. Other methods like the fortification of food with vitamins and minerals, food additives and vitamin A supplementation with capsules are effective short and midterm interventions. Despite successes though, VAD is still a serious health problem in many countries. This is due not to the lack of tools for combating the deficiency, but rather to political instability or a lack of funds or political will to act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“After 20 years and millions of dollars, ‘golden’ rice remains an illusion.  Meanwhile, the world has been tackling VAD using safer and more effective techniques.  These techniques are proven to be successful and are readily available.  ‘Golden’ rice is still a myth, and worse, it carries with it all the environmental and health risks associated with GE crops. Spending even more time and money on ‘golden’ rice development is not only environmentally irresponsible, but also a disservice to humanity.” said Dr. Chito Medina from MASIPAG.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IRRI (the International Rice Research Institute), is leading the development of ‘golden’ rice and hosts the Golden Rice Network. As such they are in a position to influence the future of this GE rice which is, at best, a distraction to solving VAD.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It is time that IRRI lets go of the illusion that GE is a tool that would benefit farmers and humankind. IRRI should start focusing its attention and resources on tools that would actually work to ensure that rice developers, growers and consumers have access to non-GE rice that is free of corporate control,” said Daniel M. Ocampo, Sustainable Agriculture Campaigner of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace demands that IRRI stop field trials of ‘golden’ and other GE rice varieties. The Gates Foundation, HarvestPlus, Rockefeller Foundation and other organisations and countries that are funding the development of ‘golden’ and other GE rice varieties should shift their resources to boost current efforts that are tackling VAD and empowering people afflicted by the deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

	International - The latest edition of the Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics exposes the widening gap between companies that make good on their promises to clean up, and those that don't. While some of the top electronics manufacturers are failing to keep their environmental commitments, others are innovating and making significant gains in phasing out toxic chemicals, increasing energy efficiency, and making it easier for consumers to recycle old products.

&lt;p&gt;We applaud &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Philips/"&gt;Philips&lt;/a&gt; for releasing the first TV free of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs). The &lt;em&gt;Econova TV&lt;/em&gt; puts Philips on track to meet its commitment to phase out these  hazardous substances by the end the year, well ahead of other TV  manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a growing gulf between companies that are consistently  innovating and leading by releasing greener products and companies that  just make big promises and excuses. As they say in the software  business: you've either shipped or you haven't.  By launching a PVC- and  BFR-free TV, Philips has overcome the technical hurdles to removing  these toxic substances from this product group. There is now no excuse  for other TV manufacturers not to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a1"&gt;The dangers of PVC and BFRs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some BFRs, used in circuit boards and plastic casings, do not break  down easily and build up in the environment.  Long-term exposure can  lead to impaired learning and memory functions. They can also interfere  with thyroid and oestrogen hormone systems and exposure in the womb has  been linked to behavioural problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PVC is a plastic used in some electronics products and for insulation  on wires and cables. Chlorinated dioxins and furans are released when  PVC is produced or disposed of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/multimedia/photo-essays/Scraplife---e-waste-in-Pakistan/"&gt;by incineration (or simply burning)&lt;/a&gt;. These chemicals are highly persistent in the environment and many are toxic even in very low concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a2"&gt;Lots more PVC- and BFR-free products&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New products free of PVC and BFRs have been put on the shelves by &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Acer/"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt;, the Indian companies Wipro and HCL, and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/HP/"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, which now has several lines of notebooks, desktops and most recently a PVC-free printer. In contrast, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Toshiba/"&gt;Toshiba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/LG/"&gt;LGE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Samsung/"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Dell/"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Lenovo/"&gt;Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; still have no whole PC product lines free from these substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toshiba is served a second penalty point this year for misleading its  customers about its commitments and a first penalty point is imposed on  &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Microsoft/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; for backtracking on commitments to remove these toxic substances.  Several other companies continue to be weighed down by penalty points  for failing to meet their phase out commitments, including LGE, Samsung,  Dell and Lenovo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple takes the biggest drop, not because it has lost any points but  because several other companies have overtaken it. LGE and Toshiba, both  previously amongst the leaders, now take 14th and 16th place, showing  that in this fast moving and innovative  sector that standing still is  just not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although scores on Waste and Recycling show the least progress  overall, Panasonic is rewarded for initiating voluntary take-back and  recycling of its TVs in India, the first programme of its kind for TVs  outside the OECD and another first for TVs. However, the industry as a  whole is failing to expand current take-back programmes to achieve  global reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panasonic is stepping up to the challenge of taking responsibility  for its end-of-life TVs – but further company initiatives to take-back  and recycle e-waste outside the rich world are desperately needed;  Panasonic’s programme could jump start this process.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace today commended President Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III’s initiative to introduce a nationwide log ban and called upon him to be resolute and demonstrate that the Executive Order to implement such a ban ensures a tangible improvement in forest governance and law enforcement.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 5px;" src="~/link/ea813e9f5ce3430198bf37008fa3bcc4.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220"&gt;“Together with the logging ban, it is important that the Executive Order also considers a participatory land use planning process based on the needs and rights of forest dependent communities with a view to protecting the climate and biodiversity.  For the ban to be effective, investment in alternatives to logging that will support local development and sustainable forest use for the benefit of local communities is critical.  This can be achieved by establishing and ensuring the participatory management of protected forest areas, ” said Mark Dia, Philippine Country Representative of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forest destruction contributes one-fifth of the total global emissions – more than the emissions from cars, planes and trains around the world combined. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last year, Greenpeace and other member organizations of the EcoWaste Coalition held a survey – the Green Electoral Initiative (GEI) – among Presidential aspirants, regarding their intentions for the environment.  Aquino had promised very concrete steps to stop illegal logging and curb the corruption that allowed loggers to circumvent environmental protection laws.  Aquino had indicated that his administration would “engage the police and military authorities, local communities and local government agencies in a sustained, vigorous campaign to seize illegally cut logs and prevent further clearing of primary forests.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deputy presidential spokesperson Abigail Valte had announced last weekend that the President is considering the possibility of an executive order for a total log ban nationwide.  The announcement was made following recent devastation brought about by heavy rains in a number of vulnerable areas in the country that suffered landslides and other debilitating effects from extreme weather events, soil erosion and other impacts of environmental degradation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the United Nations International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), droughts and typhoons will intensify, putting the most vulnerable and least prepared countries at greater risk to impacts of climate change.  The Philippines has been ranked as seventh in a list of ten countries most vulnerable to extreme weather events [1].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dia added that Aquino had made the commitment in the GEI survey that, for his first 100 days in office, he would push ‘to enact a law, as mandated by the Constitution, to delineate once and for all forest lines in the country, as a clear basis for crafting a comprehensive national land use policy, as well as for the definition of watersheds and fragile ecosystems.’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We should all hold the President to these promises he made because it will affect all of us, rich or poor.  We are already feeling the effects of climate change in our daily lives.  Both the science and people’s experiences on the ground are overtaking earlier predictions made regarding the impacts of climate change.  But the solutions are all already before us.  The only thing needed is political will and cooperation among people, government and industry.  The survival of humanity should take precedence over profit, power or greed.  But steadfast leadership and cooperation will surely get us there,” Dia concluded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes for Editors:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;[1] According to the latest Climate Risk Index of Germanwatch, the Philippines is ranked seventh in terms of Long Term Climate Risk, based on data from 1990 to 2009, also ranking third in a list of ten Most Affected Countries in 2009.

	Mindanao, in southern Philippines, is the country’s second largest island group, occupying one-third of the country’s total land area. The region depends largely on agriculture and supplies 40% of the country’s food.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindanao is also known for its rich mineral and metal deposits.  However, it is currently the least developed region in the country,  wracked by poverty and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Philippine government is keen to develop Mindanao’s energy  infrastructure as part of the island’s development plan. Mindanao relies  mainly on hydropower, which particularly this year, posed problems due  to lack of water coupled with increasing demand in power supply.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According  to the Power Development Program of the Department of Energy (DOE),  Mindanao needs an additional capacity of 850 MW to be installed for the  period 2006-2014. The Mindanao electricity grid currently has an  installed capacity of approximately 1,929 MW, of which almost 1,000 MW  is hydro, 232 MW is coal, about 100 MW is geothermal, and the balance is  oil/diesel fired.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At present there is only one coal fired power  plant in Mindanao with a capacity of 232 MW. The plant became  operational in 2006 and is located in Villanueva, Misamis Oriental. But  plans to build more coal plants in Mindanao are underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	In 2010, as this study is being published, there are
major developments in GE rice varieties occurring in
large seed companies, government-funded research
institutes and the International Rice Research Institute.
The development and testing of GE rice poses a risk
for Thailand’s rice merchandising system. If the US
experience with LL601 rice is indicative, any unintended or
accidental GE rice release within Thailand will have severe
economic consequences for Thai rice exporters.

	Mansinam, in West Papua Province, Indonesia, is an island of immense religious and historical significance.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: baseline; margin: 2px;" src="/seasia/PageFiles/259206/mansinam2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;iconic monument in Mansinam Island, West Papua, Indonesia © Greenpeace/Shailendra Yashwant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Located in the Gulf of Doreh, just south of Manokwari Regency, the island is the site where the first European Christian Missionaries  landed in Papua in 1855 to preach Christianity to the island’s indigenous people.  Their arrival spurred the conversion of much of Papua to Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year on February 5, Christian Papuans celebrate Gospel Landing Day to mark the arrival of the Bible in Papua by  going on a pilgrimage to Mansinam Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year the celebrations are a little different – Papuans arrive at the church and the cross memorial which is now entirely powered by renewable energy.  To mark Gospel Landing Day, Greenpeace has launched a pilot project promoting renewable energy in the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: baseline; margin: 2px;" src="/seasia/PageFiles/259206/mansinam1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Greenpeace campaigner and volunteer install solar panels at an iconic monument in Mansinam Island, West Papua, Indonesia ©Greenpeace/Shailendra Yashwant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The installation, a 1 kilowatt solar-wind hybrid energy system, will power the sound system, as well as the lighting in the church and in the island’s iconic cross monument. With a renewable energy-based system, the church, the center of community life in Mansinam, will not have to rely on diesel or fossil fuels for energy, and instead will harness the sun and wind right there in their own island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, conceived as an initiative that is meant to spur similar projects and stimulate and advance sustainable development in Papua, is meant to showcase how renewable energy works for the benefit of communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is putting forward a vision of green and clean development in the island.  Only such a vision, once taken on collaboratively by the local and national governments, industry, and civil society, together with the local populace, can see Papua through toward equitable progress unlimited by dirty energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Papua island abounds with natural resources, it is the poorest region in Indonesia.  Only 30.65% of the villages in Papua are electrified, well below the 2011 government target of 65% electrification ratio for all regions in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papua currently faces a choice: to opt for sustainable and equitable progress powered by renewable energy or to be locked within a dirty fossil-fueled system which brings staggering gains only to a select few while imperiling the health and lives of the majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle; margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 4px;" src="/seasia/PageFiles/259206/mansinam3.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace believes that with its current need to be electrified, its geographical condition and scattered communities, Papua is the perfect model for decentralized renewable energy grids that are ready to be harnessed today in order to power the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is part of Greenpeace’s call for an Energy Revolution in Indonesia.  The Greenpeace Energy [R]evolution published by Greenpeace together with the Engineering Center of the University of Indonesia (UI) and the European Renewable Energy Council (EREC),  is a detailed, practical blueprint for cutting carbon emissions while achieving economic growth by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy, decentralized smart girds and energy efficiency technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

	Activists from Greenpeace, Oxfam and WWF under the umbrella of A-FAB coalition (ASEAN for a Fair, Ambitious, and Binding Global Deal) called on ASEAN delegates at Cancun Climate Conference to stand firmly as a bloc and push forward the interests of the 10-nation group in order to secure the future of the region.  ASEAN nations and their rapidly emerging economies are among the most at risk from the global climate crisis -- but they also have the most to gain from a binding international agreement.

Moreover, there should be provisions for replenishing the global climate funds from the assessed contributions of Annex 1 countries equivalent to 0.5 percent&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;of GDP, to be raised to 1.5 per cent of GDP also by 2020, " said Shalimar Vitan, regional policy coordinator of Oxfam international. “Hence, we expect ASEAN to be a strong advocate for adaptation in the negotiations," she added.&lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta - Greenpeace released maps that reveal Indonesia’s forest development plans that are being pushed by the pulp, paper and palm oil industry with support from some key ministries, which if allowed to advance, will make mockery of President Yudhoyono’s commitment to reduce emissions from the forest sector.  
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://image.greenpeace.or.id/Indonesia-Map/index.html"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Maps that reveal Indonesia’s forest development plans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maps, based on Indonesian government and sectoral data, project the risks of high-carbon, high deforestation development path which Greenpeace first revealed in its recent report, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/Press-Centre/publications/Protection-Money/"&gt;“Protection Money,”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; . The report has shown how Indonesia can actually meet its economic and industry development objectives without depleting its remaining natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 4px;" src="/seasia/PageFiles/215925/aerialpicture-kalimantanbarat-072010%20(6).jpg" alt="" width="276" height="184"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Yet current expansion plans, pushed by industry with support within some Government ministries, seek to treble pulp and paper production by 2025 and double palm oil production by 2020, with additional targets for agriculture and biofuel production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenpeace forest campaigner Yuyun Indradi : &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“These maps allow anyone, anywhere, to see for themselves what could be the future for Indonesia’s forests and peatlands if they are not protected from further conversion,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The way to save these tropical forests is for a strong climate deal that includes an effective mechanism to protects forests, not with offsets that allow polluters to keep up business as usual.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s forests are at the heart of a critical decision point for negotiators at the international climate talks, currently underway in Cancun, Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments and civil society are debating a pivotal agreement on REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries), a proposed climate policy that has the potential to protect tropical forests, biodiversity, and indigenous inhabitants, while promoting economic prosperity for countries like Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to release the maps comes as Executive Director of Greenpeace International, Kumi Naidoo, met with the Head of Indonesia’s task force on REDD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kumi Naidoo : &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Greenpeace is absolutely committed to supporting the Indonesian government in its search for a low-carbon development path, which protects natural forests. To help secure this future, we have released the government and industry data  that underlies our own analysis.  We look forward to detailed and constructive discussions with all those working for a good deal on REDD.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 4px;" src="/seasia/PageFiles/101499/images/forests-love.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"&gt;Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono says he is committed to low-carbon development. A presidential decree to ensure the immediate protection of all natural forests and peatlands through a moratorium on additional forest clearance in new and existing concessions, and a plan for sustainable land use, would ensure that Indonesia does not sacrifice its natural resources to meet its development goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;With these conditions in place, Indonesia, can become a model for REDD and for low-carbon development through its protection of forests which helps tackle climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

	Our region, Southeast Asia, is home to strong grassroots environmental movements especially those opposing the spread of harmful coal and nuclear energy.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In the past years we’ve seen how great things happen when people stand up because they want to make a difference:  we’ve seen this &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-philippines/multimedia/photos/hundreds-of-people-stood-toget-2/"&gt;in Jepara in Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-philippines/multimedia/photos/prachuab-human-banner5/"&gt;in the south of Thailand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-philippines/multimedia/videos/Hundreds-form-No-to-BNPP-solidarity-message-/"&gt;in Manila, Philippines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we stand up for clean energy, we are able to make governments think twice about dirty coal or dangerous nuclear energy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just today Greenpeace stood in solidarity with thousands of Thais as they formed a human chain with 10000 people to show their opposition against coal fired power plants.  Greenpeace is calling on the Government of Thailand to make a clean energy future a reality for Thai communities by abandoning plans to build more coal fired power plants and to prioritize solutions such as renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="/seasia/PageFiles/267583/GP02.jpg" alt="" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activity was held in Tha Sala district, Nakhon Si Thammarat Province, where the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is planning to build a coal plant.  Thais are asking EGAT to withdraw its coal project due to the serious economic, social and environmental impacts it will have on host communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communities in southern Thailand say “Coal will be clean when dogs can fly.”  They say:  “we have enough fruit, we have so many fish to eat.  We are not poor. The coal industry is telling us that they will bring development to our community but this can't be true as right now we are already rich."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they say is true because coal’s effects on communities are severe.  There is no reason to choose coal when sustainable development through renewable energy is possible.  Coal is never clean.  From mining, through combustion to waste disposal, coal has dire impacts on the environment, human health, livelihoods, and the social fabric of communities living near the mines, plants and waste sites. Burning coal also accelerates climate change which will affect the whole country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communities around coal plants and coal mines in Thailand and around Southeast Asia are already suffering.  Mae Moh in Lampang province is considered to be the worst coal-fired power plant of its kind in Asia, causing sickness and disease as well as lost livelihoods. BLCP and GHECO-I coal plants, both in Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate in Rayong province are no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s 10 years of dramatic, peaceful  actions which – together with the help of thousands of people like you – has  enabled us to protect Southeast Asia from further environmental ruin in our  mission to serve as a beacon of awareness and action in the interest of  environmental protection and sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because  of your support, Greenpeace campaigns have helped achieve:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero Deforestation&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;President Yudhoyono pledges to protect Indonesia’s forests by  announcing a moratorium on all new conversions in peatlands and high conservation-carbon value forests (2010)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unilever, Kraft, Nestlé and a host of multinational corporations enact  policies to stop buying palm oil from companies that destroy forest and  peatland in Indonesia.  (2010)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The local government of Papua, Indonesia  enacts policies to end illegal logging and bans timber exports from the island  province. (2007)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Revolution&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Republic of Philippines enacts the Renewable Energy Law, paving  the way for massive uptake of clean energy in the country.  (2008)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thailand defers plans to construct a 4,000-megawatt coal-fired power  plant in Prachuab Khiri Khan Province and commits to the uptake of renewable  energy to 20 percent by 2020 in its Power Development Plan. (2008)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Indonesian government defers plans to  build a dangerous nuclear power plant and commits to the uptake of renewable  energy. (2009)&lt;/li&gt;

	Responding to news today that the palm oil arm of Sinar Mas, Golden Agri-Resources, has announced a plan to halt the destruction of Indonesia’s forests previously caused by their operations, Bustar Maitar, head of Greenpeace’s campaign to protect Indonesian forests, said: “This could be good news for the forests, endangered species like the orang-utan and for the Indonesian economy.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“On paper, the new commitments from Golden Agri are a major step towards ending their involvement in deforestation. And if they do make these changes, large areas of forests will be saved. But now they’ve actually got to implement these plans, and we’re watching closely to make sure this happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Golden Agri’s announcement today has given a huge boost to the Indonesian President’s pledge to protect forests and tackle climate change. And now the Indonesian Government must support this initiative by stopping any more licences being granted for forest and peatland clearance, and by reviewing activities in areas where licences have already been handed out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Greenpeace revelations showing the destruction caused by Golden Agri-Resources have led to international corporations such as Unilever and Nestle cancelling their contracts with the Indonesian palm oil company. However, today’s move could signal the start of a shift throughout the industry, and eventually lead to full forest and peatland protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key commitment by Golden Agri-Resources is a pledge not to clear ‘High Carbon Storage’ forest. Under the company’s new plans, they have set a provisional threshold and will not be developing land which contains over 35 tonnes of carbon per hectare. &lt;a href="http://www.un.or.id/redd"&gt;Importantly, this provisional figure is in line with figures for low carbon development recommended to the Indonesian Government by their own advisors.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="/seasia/PageFiles/132189/sentarumlake.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bustar Maitar continued: “Protecting Indonesia’s forests is good for business, the environment and future generations of all Indonesians. The need for other palm oil producers to clean up their act is now pressing, for business and environmental reasons. The Government must back efforts like those announced today by insisting on similar standards across industries operating in forest areas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAMPAIGN TIMELINE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2007 &lt;/strong&gt;– Greenpeace release report &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/reports/palm-oil-cooking-the-climate/"&gt;“Cooking the Climate”&lt;/a&gt; exposing the role of the palm oil industry in the destruction of Indonesia’s forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2008 – &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/features/unilever-monkey-business210408/"&gt;Greenpeace launch campaign against Unilever for buying palm oil from rainforest destruction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 2008 – &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/features/unilever-palm-oil080501/"&gt;Unilever undertakes to clear up supply chain and support moratorium on rainforest destruction.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 2009&lt;/strong&gt; – Unilever drops €30 million contract with Sinar Mas’ palm oil arm Golden Agri-Resources (GAR) following a new Greenpeace report showing GAR’s involvement in the destruction of peatland, rainforests and orang-utan habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 2010&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/multimedia/videos/Kit-Kat-advert/"&gt;Greenpeace launch campaign against Nestle for buying from GAR. Nestle, Kraft and Mars drop GAR contracts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2010&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/features/Sweet-success-for-Kit-Kat-campaign/"&gt;Nestle commit to new “no deforestation” policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 2010&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/climate/sinar-mas-remains-a-notorious-forest-destroye/blog/26141"&gt;GAR publish audit of own practises.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2010&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/climate/victory-burger-king-drops-forest-destroyer-si/blog/26336"&gt;Burger King drops contract with GAR as a result of the audit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2010 – &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/sinar-mas-gets-ultimatum-from-rspo-over-palm-/blog/26480"&gt;The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) criticizes GAR for its environmental and social practices.&lt;/a&gt; It will report on its progress to address the issues raised in March 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2011&lt;/strong&gt; – GAR commit to “Forest Conservation” Plan.&lt;/p&gt;

	Coal is the dirtiest, most carbon intensive of all fossil fuels, emitting 29 percent more carbon per unit of energy than oil and 80 percent more than gas, it is one of the leading contributors to climate change. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burning coal also releases massive amounts of substances such as  mercury and arsenic that are toxic to human health and create acutely  detrimental effects on developing economies. Despite all the negative  impacts of coal-based power generation, however, nothing has been done  by the Philippine government to account for the external costs of coal fired power plants much less stop the expansion of coal in the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According  to the External Cost studyii conducted by the European Commission (EC)  in 2003 on different types of power generation, coal-fired power plants  registered the highest external cost. In comparison,renewable energy  sources such as wind power exhibited the lowest external cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also  known as externalities, external costs arise when the social or  economic activities of, say, a power station, have an impact on a set of  people and when that impact is not fully accounted, or compensated for,  by the power plant. Thus, a power station that generates sulfur dioxide  or mercury emissions, causing damage to human health, imposes an  external cost. Environmental costs are thus “externalized” because,  although they are real costs to members of society, the owner of the  power station is not taking them into account when making decisions  related to his economic activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The EC study considered climate change impacts, human mortality  (i.e. reduction in life expectancy, cancers), human morbidity (i.e.  respiratory hospital admissions, restricted activity days, congestive  heart failure), its impacts on building materials (i.e. aging of  galvanized steel, paint), crops (i.e. changes in yields caused by  nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, trioxide and acid deposition), amenity  losses due to noise or spoliation of aesthetics, and the impacts of acid  and nitrogen deposition on ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;When coal companies refer to coal as a 'cheap' source of energy,  they do not tell us that coal is cheap only because Filipino taxpayers -  and communities hosting coal plants - end up shouldering the massive  costs and impacts created by burning coal for energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	Jakarta, Indonesia, 26 February 2011 -- Greenpeace has obtained a copy of a draft moratorium on forest destruction in Indonesia, due to be announced in days, that shows it will fail to protect vital rainforests, unless urgent action is taken to increase its coverage. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s proposed “moratorium” will fail to protect 45 million hectares of natural forest and peatland, e.g. an area almost twice the size of the United Kingdom, as shown by &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/reports/Indonesias-Forests-and-Peatlands/"&gt;new maps produced by Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; using the best available government data. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This covers the vast majority of forests that provide habitat to orang-utans, tigers and other endangered species, and does little to protect forests that are not already off limits under Indonesia's existing laws. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The proposed moratorium is utterly inadequate. It continues to allow the paper and palm oil industries to destroy Indonesia's rainforests, carbon-rich peatlands and biodiversity. The Government needs to take effective action that will actually protect the rainforest and the lives that depend on them now; the forests cannot wait,” said Yuyun Indradi, Greenpeace Southeast Asia Forest Campaigner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The majority of remaining forested orang-utan habitat in Indonesia would not be protected by the proposed moratorium.  In fact, Greenpeace’s maps show that the moratorium would only protect an additional 12 million hectares of forest, the vast majority of which are located in the least accessible areas of Papua and Kalimantan and are not under immediate threat of conversion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier this month the Sinar Mas Group's palm oil arm, Golden Agri-Resources, became an industry leader by announcing a new plan to stop deforestation, which if properly implemented would protect high carbon value forests. (1)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If the Government’s current proposal goes ahead, it will undermine its pledge to slash over 40 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions and global efforts to tackle climate change,” said Yuyun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes to Editors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) To meet this commitment, GAR has set a provisional threshold and will not be developing land which contains over 35 tonnes of carbon per hectare. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/press/releases/Greenpeaces-20-year-campaign-catalyzes-groundbreaking-climate-commitment-on-refrigeration-by-400-companies1/%20"&gt;The 400 member Consumer Goods Forum and major corporations like Unilever and Nestle have also said they will adopt zero deforestation policies &lt;/a&gt;after Greenpeace informed them that their products may be driving deforestation in Indonesia and elsewhere. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contact:&lt;/p&gt;

	London, 7th April 2011— A new Greenpeace report Bad Influence has revealed how advice given by global consultancy firm McKinsey to national governments could lead to an increase in the destructive logging it is intended to prevent.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As two former McKinsey executives face accusations of insider trading in the US, the report raises further questions about the consultancy giant, examining the damaging influence of McKinsey’s advice on rainforest nations’ forest protection plans. McKinsey is the market leader in advising national governments on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) programmes (1) , yet its advice has played a key role in distorting this process to a point where donor money could be used to subsidise the expansion of the logging industry. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; “Greenpeace’s report shows the destructive and perverse effects that the McKinsey approach will have when applied to REDD+. Key problems with McKinsey’s REDD + work included that it does not lead to a reduction of deforestation, provides an incentive for rainforest governments to over estimate future levels of deforestation, omits important costs and barely acknowledges governance issues in rainforest countries”, said Sarah Shoraka, Greenpeace Forest Campaigner. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; As an example Guyana’s plan, written with input from McKinsey, allows logging to increase to 20 times its current rate [pag.7] and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) plan proposes at least an additional 10 million hectares given as logging concessions [pag.6] (2).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The basis for Greenpeace’s report comes from a new study done by University College London’s prestigious Energy Institute. The study shows the inherent flaws of the Marginal carbon Abatement Cost (MAC) curve, used across the world to rank the cost effectiveness of carbon abatement measures including measures to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+). &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The Greenpeace report also shows how McKinsey’s approach offers an incentive to governments to artificially increase predicted deforestation rates so that later ‘reductions’ can secure more compensation. Such inflated projections will ultimately come at the expense of taxpayers from donor countries and the environment.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; McKinsey’s cost curve overestimates the benefits of the logging industry and underplays or entirely ignores the costs of biodiversity loss and social upheaval. In some cases reports on which McKinsey advised make recommendations based on wholly inadequate data. In the DRC study, for example, a table is given showing confidence in individual emissions factors. The table reveals that illegal logging and fuel wood factors have been reached despite there being ‘no exact data available’. It is unclear what assumptions have been made or analysis done in the absence of this data.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Rainforest nations are currently working to develop proposals for REDD schemes with $3.5 billion (3) of funding agreed at Copenhagen. McKinsey received $300,000 for its work in the DRC paid for by a Multi-Donor Trust Fund overseen by the World Bank and funded by the UK, France, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the EU (4). Norway directly funded McKinsey’s work in Indonesia (5).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If properly administered, the fund should radically reduce emissions from deforestation, which currently account for up to a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; ENDS&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; For more information, interviews contact:&lt;br&gt; Sarah Shoraka, Greenpeace Forest Campaigner &lt;a href="tel:+%2044%2020%207865%208216" target="_blank"&gt;+ 44 20 7865 8216&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; Natalia Truchi, Greenpeace Communications Manager &lt;a href="tel:+%2031%206%2024940977" target="_blank"&gt;+ 31 6 24940977&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; Pictures available from Greenpeace International Picture Desk -&lt;img class="obfimg Eoi_1" src="/seasia/Templates/Planet3/Styles/Images/emailimages/ecff50499d80f29bc8cf2f2274d588f3.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

	Bay, Laguna, Philippines - A Greenpeace decontamination unit today removed genetically-engineered Bt eggplant, locally known as ‘Talong’, from a field trial site in Barangay Paciano Rizal in Bay, Laguna, and sealed the experimental food crop in hazmat (hazardous materials) containers to prevent further contamination of neighboring fields and the environment.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left;" src="/seasia/PageFiles/263991/Greenpeace%20photo%20release-%20BT%20Talong%20Los%20Banos-17Feb2011-007.jpg" alt="" width="195" height="292"&gt;The Greenpeace activists were supported by organic farmers from Davao who had participated in a similar operation carried out by their provincial government last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace is taking action today to prevent any further contamination from these hazardous genetically engineered crops.  This Bt eggplant experiment poses a threat to the environment and to farmers’ livelihoods, aside from violating the spirit of the Organic Agriculture Act.  Once these experimental GMOs (genetically modified organisms) flower, their pollen can contaminate both conventional and organic crops, irreversibly damaging them,” said Daniel Ocampo, Sustainable Agriculture campaigner of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.  “The public has the right to a safe environment and to food sources that are not genetically engineered.  If the authorities, such as the DA, fail to uphold those rights, then it becomes legitimate for others to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has called on the Department of Agriculture (DA) to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Halt all Bt eggplant field trials in the Philippines and decontaminate all existing field trial sites with immediate effect;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement the Organic Agriculture Act and ban genetic engineering of all food crops in the Philippines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To take an active role in supplying sufficient quantity and quality of non-Bt seeds and support organic and ecological agriculture practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;Bt eggplant field trials commenced in 2010 despite massive protests by farmers and consumers.  Of the seven selected trial sites, Davao City, Baybay in Leyte, and Sta. Barbara in Iloilo, have issued municipal and barangay resolutions banning the field trials.  Similar statutes are still in process for Pangasinan, Laguna, Camarines Sur and North Cotabato, where field trials are already underway.  &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-philippines/en_31/press/releases/Greenpeace-slams-DA-on-Bt-Eggplant/" target="_blank"&gt;Field trials were also conducted in Davao city last October but the plants were uprooted by the local government to uphold a resolution banning the trials.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Like in India, there is no public support for Bt eggplant field trials and it is just not right for a few GMO proponents to conduct an open experiment that can inflict grave and possibly irreversible risks to an unsuspecting public,” added Shivani Shah, the sustainable agriculture campaigner from India who was on-hand to provide support to local efforts in implementing a shift to sustainable farming practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) eggplant is genetically-modified to contain a built-in toxin to kill the fruit-and-shoot borer insect.  It is currently not approved in any country including in India where the technology was sourced for use in the Philippines.  Last February 2010, the government of India passed a moratorium on Bt eggplant commercialization to protect the country’s agriculture.  In its decision, the Environment Ministry said that the science behind Bt eggplant is inadequate to answer the concerns raised by civil society groups, and that the country’s GMO regulatory system is inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analysis of India’s Bt brinjal (eggplant) biosafety data by Professor Gilles-Eric Seralini, a French scientist, released in 2009 shows that the GMO eggplant is unsuitable for human consumption.  &lt;a href="http://www.somloquesembrem.org/img_editor/file/SeraliniberenjenaIndia.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The analysis concluded that Bt brinjal released into the environment, for food or feed, may present a serious risk for human and animal health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace is urging DA Secretary Prospero Alcala to categorically ban all Bt Eggplant field trials.  He has already stated that Bt eggplant will not be commercialized, which renders the field trials irrelevant.  Safety concerns on Bt eggplant are still unanswered, and the risks are even more disturbing given the Philippines’ very lax and permissive regulatory systems.  Only by halting the further entry and approvals of genetically engineered food crops can the DA achieve its goal of food security and sustainable agriculture in the country,” concluded Ocampo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greenpeace campaigns for agriculture that is good for the planet and people; healthy food grown with the environment — not against it; and farming that will help us cope with climate change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Manokwari,Papua Barat,Indonesia -- Greenpeace today installed a 1 kw solar-wind hybrid energy system at Mansinam Island in Manokwari Regency, also known as the ‘Bible City,’ to mark Papua’s Gospel Landing Day, and called upon Indonesian government to fast track development of the renewable energy industry to meet the country’s growing electricity demands.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;On 5 February 1855 two European evangelists arrived at Mansinam island, off Manokwari town, to preach Christianity to the indigenous people of Papua, majority of whom are now Christians. Every year on February 5th, thousands of Papuans make an annual pilgrimage to Mansinam to celebrate  ‘Gospel Landing Day’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Papua island abounds with natural resources, it is the poorest region in Indonesia.  Only 30.65% of the villages in Papua are electrified, well below the 2011 government target of 65% electrification ratio for all regions in Indonesia. But the government plans to address this using fossil fuels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace believes that clean, renewable energy is crucial for genuine development.  Our message is clear:  sustainability and economic development go hand in hand.  Destructive, carbon intensive fossil-fuel based systems like coal and diesel have given rise to the most urgent environmental threats that our country and the world faces today.  But the solutions are in our hands. Thanks to President Yudhoyono’s commitment,  Indonesia is leading the region and the world in commitments to reduce climate causing carbon emissions. The next step is to ensure our country follows a green and sustainable pathway for development for the sake of future generations.” said Arif Fiyanto , Climate and Energy campaigner, Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the February 2011 solar-wind hybrid system installation in what is perhaps Papua’s most historic site, Greenpeace is putting forward a vision of green and clean development in the island.  Only such a vision, once taken on collaboratively by the local and national governments, industry, and civil society, together with the local populace, can see Papua through toward equitable progress unlimited by dirty energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with a massive uptake of renewable energy combined with energy efficiency measures, Indonesia can leapfrog ahead of other developing nations in meeting development and energy demands with little or no negative impact on climate and local communities.  Solar photovoltaic and wind energy technologies are an attractive option in Indonesia because the country is fragmented among numerous small islands, making it difficult to construct a comprehensive grid to reach all populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Papua currently faces a choice: to opt for sustainable and equitable progress powered by renewable energy or to be locked within a dirty fossil-fueled system which brings staggering gains only to a select few while imperiling the health and lives of the majority.. Greenpeace believes that with its current need to be electrified, its geographical condition and scattered communities, Papua is the perfect model for decentralized renewable energy grids that are ready to be harnessed today in order to power the future.  The latest advances in technology are showing how the future’s energy structures are moving away from inefficient mammoth fossil fuel power plants within centralized grids.  Papua is best placed to leap forward to renewable energy.  Fossil fuels will only entrench the province in the dirty energy of the past.” Arif added .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace Energy [R]evolution (1)  published by Greenpeace together with the Engineering Center of the University of Indonesia (UI) and the European Renewable Energy Council (EREC),  is a detailed, practical blueprint for cutting carbon emissions while achieving economic growth by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy, decentralized smart girds and energy efficiency technologies.  This phase-out of fossil fuels offers substantial benefits such as energy security, independence from world market fuel prices, reduction in pollution-related illnesses and most of all, it is an urgently needed solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to halt runaway climate change phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;“Investment in nuclear energy and its infrastructure is a  dangerous and expensive distraction from the real solutions – energy  efficiency, renewable technology and decentralised energy. By decentralising  our energy system and producing energy locally, Thailand can meet its energy  needs in a much cheaper, cleaner and safer way,” &lt;/strong&gt;said Chariya Senpong,  Greenpeace Southeast Asia climate and energy campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling on the Thai government and the  National Energy Policy Council to get smart and phase out dirty coal and  dangerous nuclear energy from the 2010 Power Development Plan, and instead  invest in sustainable and long term solutions,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/th/PageFiles/101567/images/20100922_TH_RW_Flotilla_Sichon004.jpg" alt="" width="590"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thailand’s 2010  Power Development Plan (PDP) has identified 17 potential sites for nuclear  power plants in 9 different provinces.   But local opposition to these proposals is growing, due to the inherent  risks associated with nuclear energy, ranging from Chernobyl-like accidents to  unsolved issues of nuclear waste disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the safety issues, it is a well known fact that nuclear  power is expensive, takes too long to build, does not increase national energy  independence, does not provide jobs for the local population, and is  incompatible with most grids in developing countries.  Thailand must guard against becoming locked  for decades into expensive and unsustainable patterns of energy production,  transmission and consumption. The promotion of nuclear power as the answer to  climate change is a dangerous diversion from the real solutions.  A massive uptake of renewable energy and the  adoption of energy efficiency are the only effective ways to combat climate  change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Greenpeace supports the aspirations of the Thai people for  a greener and cleaner future. The Rainbow Warrior is in Nakhon Si Thammarat in  solidarity with community movements who are opposed to large scale industrial projects  that endanger public health and safety, as well as traditional livelihoods such  as agriculture and fisheries on which millions of Thai depend.  Throughout Thailand,  from Nakhon Si Thamarat to Samui, to Chumpon, to Prachuab Kirikahn, communities  are clamoring to Turn The Tide of dirty development,” &lt;/strong&gt;said Tara Buakamsri, country  representative of Greenpeace Southeast Asia sin Thailand.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior is in Thailand for  the first leg of the &lt;strong&gt;“Turn the Tide”&lt;/strong&gt; tour of Southeast Asia.  Greenpeace is calling on ASEAN member nations  to support green investments and adopt low-carbon growth pathway for future  development.  The Tour marks 10 years of  Greenpeace Southeast Asia campaigns to protect forests, catalyze an Energy  Revolution, promote sustainable agriculture, and stop water pollution in the  region.&lt;/p&gt;

	Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand — Greenpeace today called on the Government of Thailand to make a clean energy future a reality for Thai communities by abandoning plans to build more coal fired power plants and prioritizing solutions such as renewable energy. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The call came as the environment group stood in solidarity with 10,000 people from Tha Sala district, Nakhon Si Thammarat Province who formed a human chain as a symbol that they will protect their home from coal plants slated to be built by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT).  Local communities together with key local government officials announced their call to action for EGAT to immediately withdraw its coal project due to serious economic, social and environmental impacts to host communities.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “Greenpeace is here supporting community movements who oppose dirty energy sources such as coal.  Coal is never clean.  From mining, through combustion to waste disposal, coal has dire impacts on the environment, human health and the social fabric of communities living near the mine, plants and waste sites.  Burning coal also accelerates climate change which will affect the whole country,” said Chariya Senpong, Climate and Energy Campaigner of Greenpeace Southeast Asia. “To avoid the disastrous consequences of a coal-powered future the government must embrace an energy revolution – a massive uptake of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies.  This is what the communities in Nakhon Si Thammarat and across Thailand are demanding and what the Thai government should instead deliver.”&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Based on Thailand’s Power Development Plan 2010, at least nine coal-fired power plants totaling 8,400 MW in capacity are being proposed in Thailand. Two districts in Nakhon Si Thammarat province have been identified for coal projects under the Southern Seaboard Development Program of National Economic and Social Board (NESB).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal currently accounts for one fifth of Thailand’s energy mix, comprising 12% lignite and 9% imported coal.  The proposed plan intends to drastically increase the share of imported coal to 21 % by 2030.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Coal plants in Thailand are notorious polluters.  Mae Moh in Lampang province is considered to be the worst of its kind in Asia, causing sickness and disease as well as lost livelihoods.  BLCP and GHECO-I, both in Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate in Rayong province are no different.  A 2005 study by Greenpeace revealed that fly ash from BLCP is contaminated with a range of toxic and potentially toxic elements such as mercury, cadmium, lead, arsenic and nickel, raising the possibility of widespread toxic contamination in the vicinity.  Recently, GHECO-I coal plant has been included in the list of harmful  industries list requiring mandatory environmental and health impact assessment.  Greenpeace asserts that there is no such thing as “clean” coal technology.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “Thailand's development direction should consider community welfare.  The government’s coal plan is not the right answer of Thailand’s energy security. Today, Tha Sala people are rising up and saying ‘no to coal’ as part of an ever expanding nationwide anti-coal movement in Thailand.  Communities will continue to reject coal and  demand renewable energy and energy decentralization in our community,” said Songwut Patkaew, community leader of Nakhon Si Thammarat.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; During their flagship’s Rainbow Warrior Tour of Southeast Asia last year, Greenpeace also supported community movements in Nakhon Si Thammarat. The environment groups is campaigning for an ‘Energy [R]evolution,’ a sustainable pathway to phase out dirty and dangerous fuels by transitioning to renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donate to Greenpeace.&lt;/strong&gt;  Our work is supported by  individuals, not corporations or governments.   Perhaps one of the easiest ways you can be part of our work for the  environment is to support us financially.   Join us and Turn the Tide! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a Greenpeace cyberactivist. &lt;/strong&gt; Do you know that online petitions and social  media get results?  That’s how Greenpeace  got big corporations, like Nestlé, to stop buying products from forest  destroyers.  &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/sign"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Become a Greenpeace  volunteer.&lt;/strong&gt;  Greenpeace  works with thousands of dedicated, smart volunteers who form the backbone of our  campaigns.  &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/sign"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be more informed.&lt;/strong&gt;  Experts say the more you  know about climate change, the more you will want to do something about  it.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;  Check your own home and your  habits and see what you can start changing. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save energy.&lt;/strong&gt;  You reduce your carbon  footprint when you use energy saving light bulbs and when you switch off your  lights and unplug your appliances when not in use. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conserve water.&lt;/strong&gt;  When you use water wisely,  you preserve drinking water supplies, and you save energy too!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce your waste.&lt;/strong&gt;  Avoid making more garbage by  buying less, avoiding disposable products, and refusing plastic bags and  styrofoam packaging&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be part of the movement.&lt;/strong&gt;  Get committed to protecting  the climate by joining an initiative or a movement that promotes climate change  solutions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spread the word.&lt;/strong&gt;  Tell  your family, your friends, your office mates,  your boss, your classmates and so on about how they too can make a  difference.  Give this brochure away (or  its e-copy) and share these 10 tips! &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/RW10brochure"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	Greenpeace today called upon President Yudhoyono to fast track implementation of the two year moratorium on forest conversion, by ensuring transparency in the decision making process and allowing community involvement to put in place effective law enforcement and good governance measures for forest protection and sustainable development of the millions of forest dependent people.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;2010 was an historic year for the protection of Indonesia’s last remaining forests following President Yudhoyono’s pronouncement of the two-year moratorium that was due to enter into force on 1 January 2011. However, forest clearance still continues due to the delay in the moratorium implementation. The moratorium is the critical first step for the US$1 billion forest protection funding from Norway to be allocated most effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“2011 can be the landmark year for Indonesia’s forests and our contribution to global efforts to combat climate change, but President Yudhoyono’s commitment is being stalled and delayed by the usual set of vested interests within his own government,” said Joko Arif, Greenpeace Southeast Asia forests campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Massive efforts are being made by the industry and its representatives in the government through the Ministry of Forestry to undermine, dilute and stall the action plan being recommended by the President’s special taskforce for implementation of the moratorium. The President must thwart these attempts and make sure that his government is able follow best practices as recommended by civil society and as required under the Norway agreement”, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norway and Indonesia have proposed a plan that has the potential to be a benchmark for future deals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by protecting Indonesia’s natural forests and carbon-rich peatlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be the first demonstration of the much awaited REDD in action, and if the rules are right, it will give much needed impetus to the ongoing efforts of the United Nations to curb greenhouse gas emissions from the forestry sector. Some of the basic elements of the agreement are encouraging, such as its focus on providing additional emissions reductions, which means that emissions savings will not offset pollution in another part of the world in the form of carbon offsets; a moratorium on new concessions to convert forests into agricultural lands; transparent processes; and the delivery of national-level reductions and independent monitoring systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“However, the new moratorium will not cover the millions of hectares of forests already slated for destruction. What's more, as shown in the recent Greenpeace report, “REDD Alert: Protection Money”, deals such as this face serious risks as industries involved in forest destruction position themselves for REDD funds. In Indonesia, there is a push to reclassify the definition of forests in order to divert money earmarked for forest protection into destructive, business-as-usual practices. The Government has to finish its homework to ensure the moratorium can really save Indonesia’s forests. The different government ministries have to agree the scope of the moratorium, forests definition, and reviewing existing permits in natural forests and peatlands,” said Yuyun Indradi, Greenpeace Southeast Asia political campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indonesia cannot afford to miss this opportunity to save its remaining forests as millions people whose livelihoods depend on the forests and the climate cannot wait. If the government can provide transparency, shift to good governance and law enforcement, whilst involving local communities and civil society, we are positive that 2011 will indeed be a landmark year for Indonesia’s forests,” Yuyun concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greenpeace is an independent, global campaigning organization that acts to change attitudes and behavior, to protect and conserve the environment, and to promote peace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Frankfurt – Greenpeace activists presented a Golden Chainsaw Award to Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) yesterday (local time) at Paperworld, an international paper fair in Frankfurt. The award coincides with the UN’s unveiling of 2011 as the International Year of Forests. (1)
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenpeace is awarding APP a Golden Chainsaw for being one of the worst forest destroyers in Indonesia. We are calling on the company to clean up its act by halting rainforest destruction, which drives climate change and pushes endangered species towards extinction,” said Corinna Hölzel, forest campaigner, Greenpeace Germany. “Several companies like Metro and Adidas have already broken ties with APP due to its bad practices - we advise others to protect their brands and follow their lead.” (2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace investigations into deforestation in Indonesia (3) exposed that APP, Sinar Mas’ pulp and paper division, is converting huge areas of forest and carbon-rich peatlands into acacia and eucalyptus plantations in order to produce packaging as well as printing, photocopy and tissue paper in Indonesia and China, which it sells worldwide. This deforestation destroys the natural habitat of endangered species like the orang-utan and releases enormous quantities of CO2, making Indonesia the third largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. (4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace investigation also discovered that APP plans to expand its operations into one of the last refuges for the critically endangered Sumatran tiger. (5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is calling for an immediate end to the destruction of all Indonesia’s natural forest and peatlands, the world’s most critical carbon stores, through a moratorium on the destruction of forests in both new and existing concessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Life on Earth needs healthy rainforests to survive and yet, globally, an area of forest the size of 35 football pitches is destroyed every minute. (6) It is vital that companies like APP put down their chainsaws and instead increase their productivity areas that have already been destroyed,” said Hölzel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Adidas, Kraft, Nestlé, Unilever, McDonald’s and Mars, as well as retailers such as Carrefour, Auchan, Leclerc, Sainsbury, Marks &amp;amp; Spencer, Tesco and Metro have all said they will cut ties with APP if it does not fundamentally change its approach to sustainability. Given the recent announcement by the Consumer Goods Forum on action against deforestation, it is likely that other companies will cut ties with APP in the near future.

	Bangkok/Jakarta/Manila, 26 April 2011— Greenpeace today marked the 25th anniversary of Chernobyl nuclear disaster with a call to governments of Southeast Asia to  abandon all plans to develop nuclear power plants in the region to ensure safety of its citizens.  Greenpeace is calling on ASEAN heads of state to invest heavily in energy efficiency and harness clean, safe renewable energies to meet their country’s energy requirements instead of dirty coal and dangerous nuclear energy.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;In Bangkok,  Greenpeace along with other NGOs launched the &lt;strong&gt;“Thai Citizens No Nukes Network” during a public forum co-organized by Chulalongkorn University Social Research Institute entitled “From Chernobyl to Fukashima.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jakarta, Greenpeace and other NGOs in the Indonesian anti-nuclear movement, including Walhi, IESR, Marem and nuclear experts, launched the report &lt;strong&gt;"Public Lies of Nuclear Promoters in Indonesia"&lt;/strong&gt; to expose government-sanctioned deception to create public acceptance for dangerous nuclear energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Metro Manila, Greenpeace activists in black cloaks and masks took the message to the doorsteps of the Philippine Department of Energy as they held a grim procession highlighting 25 of the world’s worst nuclear disasters to challenge Energy Secretary Jose Almendras to strike out all nuclear options in Philippine energy plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Chernobyl is to date the world’s worst civilian nuclear accident but the unfolding disaster in Fukushima, Japan demonstrates that no amount of technological sophistication or safety culture can prepare any country or its people to the inherent dangers of nuclear energy.  Like in Chernobyl, the Fukushima incident has shown that we cannot control or manage nuclear energy and its fallout. ”&lt;/strong&gt; said Tara Buakamsri, Campaigns Director, Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quarter of a century after Chernobyl, the situation in the area surrounding the Chernobyl reactor show few signs of improvement.  Widespread contamination, constant resettlements and long-term health impacts still pose threats to communities.  And, despite ‘modernizations’ the root causes of nuclear technology’s vulnerability to accidents remain the same: unexpected technological failures, operator errors, poor safety standards due to political and economic pressures, lack of transparency in the industry as a whole, and natural disasters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia is home to strong grassroots movements against dangerous nuclear energy, and dirty coal power.  However, nuclear energy promoters in Southeast Asia are ignoring the clear warnings and downplaying the risks.  As Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines, as well as Vietnam and Malaysia are entertaining plans to build nuclear power plants in next few decades.  ASEAN countries, despite their vulnerability to natural disasters in the Pacific “ring of fire” and their general lack of disaster preparedness, have not yet ruled out nuclear power and the great costs and risks it entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs to manage the Chernobyl disaster which up to now continues to drain Ukraine and Europe millions of Euro annually, is estimated to cost more than 350 billion Euro.  The disaster also severely contaminated between 125,000 and 150,000 square kilometres in Belarus, Russia and the Ukraine.  A Greenpeace-commissioned study based on Belarus national cancer statistics estimated that approximately 270,000 cancers and 93,000 fatal cancer cases will be caused by Chernobyl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace believes that to secure a safe and better future countries must choose renewable energy over nuclear power.  Greenpeace has long argued that renewable energy has the potential to meet a substantial share of our future energy demand. The Energy [R]evolution  scenario details how – combined with energy efficiency and a transformed electricity grid – renewable energy could produce 95% of electricity worldwide by 2050. Other studies have made predictions for different time frames or regions. PricewaterhouseCoopers, for example, predicts that Europe and North Africa could run on 100% renewable energy by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is an independent global campaigning organisation that acts to change attitudes and behaviour, to protect and conserve the environment and to promote peace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The new Rainbow Warrior will be all of these things and more:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Eco-warrior&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class="facts"&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Every aspect of the design and 	build has been done to make the ship as clean and green as possible &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Rainbow Warrior III will sail 	under wind power, but electric diesel engines are available when 	needed &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Heat from the engine and 	generators will be recycled to heat cabins and provide hot water &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; A greywater system will be used on 	board &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Constructed to operate anywhere in 	the world outside the polar regions &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Activist and analyst&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class="facts"&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Cranes at the front and back of 	the ship will enable her to carry specialist scientific equipment up 	to 8 tonnes in weight &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Flexible space means scientists 	can conduct analysis on the ship rather than waiting ‘til they 	return to shore &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Illegal fishing vessels can be 	spotted up to 15 miles away from the 50metre crows nest &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; With a top speed of 15 knots she 	can keep up with industrial vessels &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Special winces called ‘Davits’ 	mean the ships three inflatables can be deployed in minutes, with 	the crew onboard, even with 3.5 metre high waves. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Communications hub&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class="facts"&gt;
&lt;li&gt; An 	onboard satellite communications system gives 24/7/365 broadband 	access anywhere in the world, letting the ship stream live footage 	from actions or interviews with campaigners direct to the world’s 	media. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; A 	secure radio room and onboard server room sit behind steel bulkheads 	meaning we can keep transmitting even if the ship is boarded &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Dedicated 	press conference room – a welcome change from hosting conferences 	in the rain or in the cramped small gallery &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Helicopter 	landing pad and storage bay give us an eye in the sky, letting us 	document activities from the air &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Home away from home&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class="facts"&gt;
&lt;li&gt; On board medical facilities mean 	the crew will be well looked-after anywhere in the world &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; A well equipped galley and an 	onboard freezer big enough to hold 14000 litres of ice-cream &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Giant of the oceans&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class="facts"&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Rainbow 	Warrior III will be 58 metres long, 11 metres wide, and the masts 	will be over 50metres high – that’s the length of two blue 	whales. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; She’ll 	weigh 838 tonnes – about the same as 230 elephants &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Moratorium maps recently released by the government claim 72 million hectares of forest will be protected. However, Greenpeace analysis of these maps clearly shows that 1,7 million hectares are still inside concession areas, which overlap the moratorium maps, but could be destroyed. Indonesia’s already huge greenhouse gas emissions would spike and large tracts of natural forest, critical for the survival of forest dependent communities and endangered species like the orangutan and Sumatran tiger, would be lost forever.

&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Click &lt;a href="http://image.greenpeace.or.id/peta-hutan/overlapping_map_moratorium_vs_hti_riau.jpg"&gt;for largest map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Government must urgently conduct the permit review as the first step to strengthening law enforcement in the forestry sector, which has up until now been a den of corruption,” said Yuyun Indradi, Political Forest Campaigner Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Ongoing investigations conducted by Greenpeace show that some companies continue to destroy forests in areas that are protected under the Moratorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;The Moratorium in its current weak form will stop President Yudhoyono delivering on his commitment to reduce carbon emissions by between 26% - 41% by 2020. The next two years should instead be used to improve forest management and law enforcement through reviewing existing permits and strictly enforcing the law and respecting local community rights to resolve land tenure conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;There is also a clear contradiction between the moratorium policy and pulp and paper industry production. Only 43% of the 10 million hectares of Industrial Forest Plantations (HTI) has been planted, which means most of the wood supply still comes from natural forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;“The inefficient and unproductive forest industry is also a factor inhibiting the implementation of the moratorium. Instead of encouraging an increase in production from existing concessions, the government conversely provide flexibility for the industry to continue to destroy natural forest, livelihoods and biodiversity,” said Muhammad Teguh Surya, Head of Climate Justice Department, WALHI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;WALHI also urged President Yudhoyono to immediately address the government’s failing efforts to reduce emissions from Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;The government fear of the impending economic collapse due to the implementation of moratorium is also unfounded, as the plantation and forestry sector contributes only 1% of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;“The government should also extend the mandate of the REDD+ Task Force (UKP4) (3) to intensify the implementation of the presidential decree, conduct the permit review and enforce the law to stamp out corruption in the forestry sector,” said Giorgio Budiarto, Forest and Climate Change Program Manager (ICEL)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;The Indonesian civil society coalition urges the government to act quickly to put clear policy instruments in place to strengthen, implement and enforce the moratorium in its remaining 21 months in order to protect and restore Indonesia’s remaining forests.&lt;/p&gt;

	Along awaited plan to put a temporary halt to forest destruction in Indonesia does not go far enough and will still see tens of millions of hectares of forests facing destruction, warned Greenpeace.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The environmental campaigners did recognise, however, that the moratorium was “an important political shift”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moratorium will put a two-year halt to new logging areas on ‘primary’ forest, which contains areas untouched by humans, and areas containing peat, the destruction of which releases large amounts of climate changing pollution. But Greenpeace have said that this does not go far enough, and large areas of forests, including some of the last habitats of species like the orang-utan and the Sumatran tiger, have been left out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Greenpeace, about 40 million hectares of forest could still be destroyed under the moratorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reacting to today’s much anticipated plan, Bustar Maitar of Greenpeace, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This moratorium represents an important political shift towards protecting our forests. But unfortunately, it doesn’t go any further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Millions of hectares of forests will still be destroyed. And most of the areas included on the map are already protected, so the moratorium offers ‘little’ extra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the forests, large scale destruction will continue as usual. This announcement is a long way from the Indonesian President’s commitment to protect Indonesia forests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under today’s plan to halt forest and peatland destruction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only      new concessions to destroy forest will be suspended; the millions of      hectares of forest already slated for destruction continue to be under      threat; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;degraded      forests that are rich in biodiversity, or valuable for other conservation      reasons are not protected; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;peatlands,      which store enormous quantities of carbon, remain vulnerable to      destruction.&lt;/li&gt;

	Greenpeace today issued a bold challenge to social networking giant Facebook, calling on it to embrace a clean energy future and to develop a plan by Earth Day (April 22nd) that would end its use of coal to provide electricity to the company’s rapidly expanding computer network. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 5px;" src="~/link/69d869afd6e14bc1becbe10062c39e9b.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="250"&gt;This latest move in Greenpeace’s “Facebook: Unfriend Coal” campaign, already backed by 600,000 supporters (1), follows last week’s recorded interview (2) at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo discussed Facebook’s potential to become a world leader in clean energy with Facebook’s director of marketing, Randi Zuckerberg. Naidoo presented Ms. Zuckerberg with a pledge for her brother (3), CEO Mark, to sign by Earth Day. The pledge calls upon Facebook to agree by April 22nd to what Greenpeace calls The Big IDEA, which is a commitment to: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Increase Facebook’s use of clean energy;&lt;br&gt;• Develop a plan to mitigate Facebook’s climate footprint and to become coal free by 2021;&lt;br&gt;• Educate Facebook users about how the company powers its services.&lt;br&gt;• Advocate for clean energy at a local, national and international level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Facebook has become a household name used every day by millions of people; unfortunately, it’s relying on 19th century dirty coal power to deliver its 21st century services,” said Greenpeace energy campaigner Casey Harrell. “People from all over the world are asking the company they love to lead the Energy Revolution by un-friending coal. Will Mark Zuckerberg rise to the challenge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign to green Facebook is expanding into new languages and countries, including France, Indonesia, New Zealand, UK, and Turkey. Student groups are now taking the message to US university campuses and educating their classmates about Facebook’s growing footprint. In the coming weeks, students will be telling Facebook staff that they want their online life to be green. (4) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Facebook’s visionary approach to business changed how we live our lives online,” Harrell said. “The company has a real opportunity to lead by example by extending this spirit of innovation to the environment, by showing that businesses can flourish by being clean energy-powered, like Pepsico, and Proctor and Gamble have pledged to do.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IT companies are rapidly increasing their consumption of electricity, and present one of the largest areas in the growth of electricity demand. The amount of electricity produced and consumed to power just the Internet, would place it 5th if ranked among countries by electricity consumption. (5)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2010 Facebook chose to increase demand for coal power when it decided to build its first two data centres, located in Oregon and North Carolina, from utilities that generate a majority of their electricity from coal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More detailed information can be found at www.greenpeace.org/unfriendcoal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contacts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	She's been bombed, impounded, rammed by government ships, raided by police... and loved by millions of people. After 52 years at sea (21 years as a Greenpeace campaigning ship), the current Rainbow Warrior is heading for retirement.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;She has challenged the legal system and won, she’s confronted environmental crimes,  relocated the population of a South Pacific Island contaminated by  radiation, provided disaster relief to victims of the 2004 Tsunami in  South East Asia, and sailed against whaling, war, global warming, and  other environmental crimes on every ocean of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the Rainbow Warrior campaign timeline below to find out more about her battles, victories and  humanitarian work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please help her proud legacy continue by making a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/supportus/Help-build-the-Rainbow-Warrior-III/"&gt;donation to the  new Rainbow Warrior today&lt;/a&gt;.  She is more needed now than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

            World Bank fails to heed its own advice on climate change and risks to the poor; continues support for coal in Indonesia

				&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/112151_184488.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batang residents take action to agains Coal Fired Power Plant in their land.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the world, countries look to the World Bank more than any other institution for the latest expertise and assistance on development.  This week in Washington, DC the Spring Meetings of the World Bank will bring together thousands of government officials, civil society organizations, journalists and private sector representatives to debate the institutions’ work and implications for international development.  With the United Nations’ climate negotiations set to make a global agreement in Paris this December, it is a critical time for the Bank to put forward ambitious and concrete commitments on how the World Bank will lead the world onto a low-carbon development path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/speech/2014/12/08/transforming-the-economy-to-achieve-zero-net-emissions"&gt;recent speech&lt;/a&gt; the World Bank President, Jim Yong Kim, stressed “…if we don't confront climate change, there will be no hope of ending poverty…”  He called on countries to agree in Paris to binding language that provides a clear pathway to zero net greenhouse gas emissions before 2100, which is necessary in order to achieve the globally agreed goal of limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank needs to heed its own advice and follow a clear pathway to low-carbon development – starting with its own energy sector operations.  Unfortunately, &lt;strong&gt;the World Bank continues to finance fossil fuel projects and policies that are locking countries into carbon intensive infrastructure that undermine the 2 degree goal. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the World Bank continues to support the development of the 2,000 MW Batang coal power plant in Central Java and two Sumsel coal-fired power plants of 1,200 MW and 600 MW in South Sumatra.  Through &lt;a href="http://priceofoil.org/2013/09/25/world-bank-accelerating-coal-development-indonesia/"&gt;four World Bank infrastructure policy lending operations&lt;/a&gt; worth $850 million, Indonesia established the Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund(IIGF) and the 2012 Land Acquisition Law to support a development model based on public-private partnerships (PPP).  The IIGF provided its first government guarantee of $34 million to the Central Java coal power plant of Batang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the World Bank has a direct $30 million loan to the IIGF which, according to the Bank, involves “a platform for ongoing engagement in the development and appraisal of PPP infrastructure operations” seeking IIGF guarantees.  Part of this on-going Bank engagement involves ensuring IIGF projects abide by an Operations Manual that is based on the Bank’s own Social and Environmental Safeguards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/112153_184484.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/112150_184490.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nearly four years, thousands of Batang residents have struggled against the development of the Batang coal power megaplant to protect their productive agricultural land and rich fishing grounds, which their livelihoods depend on. They have been threatened and attacked by thugs, police, army, and government agents. They and Greenpeace and other groups have protested, filed a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission, and commenced a process to lodge a formal complaint within JBIC. A lawsuit has been filed against the project for environmental violations.  The Ministry of Environment itself is currently reviewing the plant’s EIA. Residents and landowners have complained of facing intimidation and violence to force them to sell their land against their will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the World Bank’s 2013 Annual Meetings, a member of Greenpeace Indonesia traveled to Washington, DC to inform the Bank of the Batang communities’ rejections to the coal plant and local and global &lt;a href="http://priceofoil.org/content/uploads/2013/11/Civil-Society-Letter-to-WB-Pres-Kim-Indonesia-Coal-Oct-2-2013.pdf"&gt;civil society groups sent a letter calling on the World Bank&lt;/a&gt; to request that the government of Indonesia cancel its loan guarantee. But, the Bank dismissed this request and the communities’ concerns stating the Bank was not involved in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continued refusal by villagers to sell their land for the proposed coal plant has forced the Indonesian government to extend the deadline for financial closure of the project for three consecutive years.  &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-indonesia/press/releases/Tak-Penuhi-Tenggat-Waktu-PLTU-Batubara-Batang-Melanggar-Hukum-Jika-Diteruskan/#a0"&gt;Greenpeace Indonesia reports&lt;/a&gt; that, “According to Presidential Regulation No. 66 of 2013: if the companies fail to finish the land acquisition process for Batang in the time allotted, and fail to respect the deadline (October 6, 2014), the agreement between the government and consortium will end and the project must be canceled.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the proposed Batang coal plant has not been canceled. Instead, the project has recently requested that the government-owned power company, PLN, exercise a consignment clause in the World Bank-supported 2012 Land Acquisition Law to acquire the remaining land. The troubles with the Batang plant also did not cause the World Bank to halt the IIGF from approving further government guarantees for two more coal power plants in February this year in South Sumatra – Sumsel 9 and 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to point out that the IIGF has not provided any government guarantees to clean renewable energy infrastructure projects. This is all the more shocking considering Indonesia’s vast and largely untapped potential for geothermal, solar, and other renewable energies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In President Kim’s speech he specifically called on countries to end harmful subsidies to fossil fuels.  Meanwhile, the World Bank continues to create new subsidies to fossil fuels through government guarantees and tax breaks for infrastructure investments, especially in the case of PPP projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank must stop turning a blind eye to the multiple ways it provides support to coal and other fossil fuels. Through policy lending and financial intermediaries like the IIGF, the World Bank is continuing to lock the world into carbon intensive development, which undermines the 2 degree goal and, thus, provides “no hope of ending poverty. &lt;strong&gt;"The World Bank must heed its own advice on confronting climate change, and start by challenging the destructive Batang coal power plant now."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;When thousands of women come together to mark International Women’s Day on 8 March - either on the streets or at home or in the workplace - they will do so as part of a growing and very powerful force, one that knows that positive change can happen if we fight for it. And we will. They know that it is possible because “women hold up half the sky”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will come together knowing that the powerful vested interests shoring up the dying fossil fuel industry have been given a reprieve by President Trump in his first weeks in office, but it is not a sustainable nor acceptable one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odds may seem stacked against us and it would not be the first time that our rights have been eroded. But I am hopeful. More than that, I am fired up because so many are unwilling to go backwards and I know that these forces standing in our way are the last gasp of an energy system which is already changing. And it is women who are driving a lot of that change by standing up and speaking out in all corners of the world for our rights, our health, our families and our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/community_images/84/2284/134337_238424.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am inspired too, by the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/dakota-access-pipeline-protest-standing-rock-women-police-abuse" target="_blank"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt; of Standing Rock, who have faced threats and intimidation in their resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline which will cross their ancestral land. By women like &lt;a href="http://www.goldmanprize.org/recipient/aleta-baun/" target="_blank"&gt;Aleta Baun&lt;/a&gt;, who led 150 women in her village in Timor, Indonesia, in a peaceful protest against a mining company which was trying to exploit a mountain which is the source of water for her indigenous Mollo people. And by &lt;a href="http://indigenous2015.org/content/hindou-oumarou-ibrahim" target="_blank"&gt;Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim&lt;/a&gt; who is working to contain the humanitarian and environmental damage caused by the drying up of Lake Chad - whose waters sustain 30 million people in the Sahel region of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These women are on the frontline of the fight against fossil fuels and for justice for those suffering the worst impacts of climate change, because it is their communities which are most affected. They show what women can do when we stand together because, as Hindou Oumarou &lt;a href="http://www.vogue.com/projects/13373340/climate-change-summit-women-cop21-warriors-global-warming/" target="_blank"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, “we know that the future — it’s coming from us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see the future and the hundreds of thousands of women who joined the women’s marches on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March" target="_blank"&gt;January 21&lt;/a&gt; are already fighting for it. It’s a future which embraces equal rights and care for our land, air and water - the life support systems that intimately bind the fates of people and our planet. The gates to this future are already open, women are streaming through and we will overcome those who stand in our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/community_images/84/2284/134336_238422.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we know they will try. In his first few weeks in office, President Trump is rolling back regulations that protect land, air and water from pollution, solely in the interests of the fossil fuel industry. They will do everything to turn back the clock, undermine hard-fought victories that protect our rights and our common home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a worldwide struggle and for too many people, the fight for climate justice has come at a terrible price. Nearly a hundred brave women and men have been murdered since 2010, 33 of them in 2015 alone, because they stood up to those who poison their air and water and who take their land and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just last month, an environmental lawyer on the island of Bohol in the central Philippines, Attorney Mia Mascariñas-Green, was &lt;a href="http://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/122964/enviromental-lawyer-ambushed-killed-presence-3-young-kids-bohol" target="_blank"&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt; dead as she drove through town with her three young children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To her, death threats were part of the job. Yet this did not deter her to fight for the causes she held dear, including women’s rights and environmental justice. She remained fearless until the very end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the Honduran Lenca activist and Goldman environmental prize winner, &lt;a href="http://bertacaceres.org/bertas-assassination-anniversary-berta-caceres-act-global-witness-report/" target="_blank"&gt;Berta Caceres&lt;/a&gt;, was murdered for her opposition to the construction of hydroelectric dams which are choking off her people’s water supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berta knew the risks she faced. But she also knew why she had to fight. “We have no replacement planet, we have only this one,” she said. “And we have to take action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These assassinations will not stop women fighting for environmental justice. Because when the living world we all depend on suffers, because of the short term narrow interests of fossil fuel corporations and the impacts of climate change, it is often women who feel it first.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With women producing between 60-80% of food in many developing countries, we are the first to be affected by changes in weather patterns caused by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also &lt;a href="https://news.vice.com/article/how-climate-change-impacts-women-the-most" target="_blank"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt; and girls who collect the water. So when rains fail, or water tables drop, they must walk further and further to find it. For every hour a girl must spend collecting water, she cannot be in school so her education suffers too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/community_images/84/2284/134332_238414.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is no surprise that from the grassroots to the highest diplomatic channels, women are fighting for the right to a healthy, sustainable future. We are leading, innovating and bringing about change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we will prevail. As the Indian writer Arundhati Roy wrote: “Another world is not only possible, she is on her way. On a quiet day, I can hear her breathing.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bunny Mcdiarmid is&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Executive Director of Greenpeace International.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The launch of the Greenpeace Toxic Free Water project entitled “Citarum Nadi Ku, Mari Rebut Kembali” (Let’s Take Back Our Citarum), coincided with the release of a public opinion poll conducted by LP3ES that estimates that 81% of people in and around Bandung agree that industries should stop polluting Western Java’s most important freshwater source. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p class="normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food scandals like this happen more often than you think and may affect you more than you know — even if you don’t live in Brazil.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;&lt;img title="Livestock Farm in Brazil. 30 Mar, 2009  © Ricardo Funari / Lineair / Greenpeace" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/community_images/84/2284/134651_239183.jpg" alt="Livestock Farm in Brazil. 30 Mar, 2009  © Ricardo Funari / Lineair / Greenpeace" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Have you heard about the &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption-food-idUSKBN16R1MH"&gt;shocking rotten meat scandal&lt;/a&gt;? Brazilian police unveiled an investigation exposing systemic bribing of Brazilian meat inspectors by major meat-packing companies, some of these top global companies trade in Southeast Asia, to conceal dirty meat by paying them to issue false “fit-to-eat” certifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Details emerging from the investigation include practices such as adding chemicals to meat to conceal rotting odor, adding pigs’ heads to sausages and adding cardboard to processed poultry as filler. &lt;a href="http://oglobo.globo.com/economia/ex-ministra-confessa-que-por-pressao-politica-nomeou-bandido-no-parana-21094194"&gt;Local press is also reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Brazil’s former agriculture minister admitted to caving into political pressure to appoint a livestock superintendent who would support the rotten meat cover-up scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/world/americas/brazil-food-companies-bribe-scandal-salmonella.html"&gt;More than 30 companies were implicated&lt;/a&gt; in the sting including JBS, the world’s largest beef exporter, and BRF, the world’s largest poultry exporter. China, Hong Kong, Chile and the European Union have issued temporary bans on Brazilian beef imports until its safety can be confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In Southeast Asia, Vietnam is mulling a &lt;a href="http://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/vietnam-puts-brazilian-meat-imports-on-the-table-3559584.html"&gt;ban&lt;/a&gt; while authorities in &lt;a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ntuc-fairprice-seeking-clarification-from-suppliers-about-brazilian-meat-products"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.theborneopost.com/2017/03/24/embassy-brazil-meat-in-malaysia-free-from-rotten-meat-scandal/"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; said that the countries are not importing meat from the Brazilian companies involved. Authorities in other Southeast Asian countries have yet to issue a statement. In 2016, the Philippines &lt;a href="http://www.bai.da.gov.ph/index.php/stakeholders-corner/importation-data"&gt;imported&lt;/a&gt; 18.5M kg of beef, 32.3M kg of poultry and 158,563 kg of corned beef from Brazil. In Thailand, Brazilian meat import, ranks only &lt;a href="http://www.customs.go.th/statistic_report.php?show_search=1"&gt;6th&lt;/a&gt;  valued at THB 27M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Hours after the scandal broke, Brazilian President Michel Temer went into damage control mode by inviting &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-19/brazil-tainted-meat-probe-widens-as-trade-partners-study-impact"&gt;19 ambassadors to a Brazilian steakhouse&lt;/a&gt; to send the signal that the country’s meat is safe to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But sadly, this is not a problem that can be fixed in a single meal. And it’s not a problem confined to a single country. All of this points to a deep disease in the industrial meat and dairy system worldwide. Industrialized farming has been linked time and time again to outbreaks of &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_east/6983113.stm"&gt;E. coli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/2011/ground-turkey-11-10-2011.html"&gt;salmonella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2014/09/danish-listeria-outbreak-claims-15-victims/#.WNJjnBLytTY"&gt;listeria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/clampdown-at-bernard-matthews-farm-in-bird-flu-scare-8577194.html"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/mexican-lawmaker-factory_b_191579.html"&gt;swine flu&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="http://archive.onearth.org/articles/2013/12/you-wont-believe-the-crap-literally-that-factory-farms-feed-to-cattle"&gt;Mad Cow disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Just yesterday, less than one week after the rotten meat scandal broke, Brazilian meat corporations were caught yet again, this time in a separate investigation buying 58,000 cattle from illegally deforested lands, even after signing an agreement promising to protect the Amazon from deforestation. &lt;a href="http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/business/2017/03/1869025-ibama-action-against-deforestation-impacts-jbs-meatpacking-plants.shtml"&gt;More here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;How many more meat scandals do we need, in order to realize that there is something wrong with this industrial meat and dairy model being pushed by these corporations, across the globe. The whole industrial meat model relies upon one basic principle: raise and slaughter animals as quickly as possible and by whatever means necessary to  maximize profits. This often means keeping cows, swine and chickens in high-density confinement with other animals, surrounded by their own fecal matter, making them petri dishes for disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;&lt;img title="A worker handles butchered livestock in a slaughterhouse facility in Brazil. 1 Apr, 2009  © Ricardo Funari / Lineair / Greenpeace" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/community_images/84/2284/134674_239235.jpg" alt="A worker handles butchered livestock in a slaughterhouse facility in Brazil. 1 Apr, 2009  © Ricardo Funari / Lineair / Greenpeace" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The best way to protect our families from outbreaks is to change this system and commit to less and better meat, if we choose to eat it at all. The reality is that when it comes to meat, we need a new normal. We don’t need it in every meal to be happy and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And if we do eat meat, go for “better meat” produced by our local farmers who use nature and biodiversity, not chemicals, to grow animals with high welfare standards, rejecting antibiotics, monoculture of genetically-engineered feed and accelerated lifespans for profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In addition to protecting our health, less meat protects the planet. Humanity’s appetite for meat and dairy and expanding industrial production are catastrophic for the environment — from destruction of forests and grasslands to pollution of water and air and major contributions to global climate change (more than &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/"&gt;14% of global greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It is time for us to re-examine our diets and switch to a more plant-based (less meat), diverse diet for health, climate, forests and global food security. Let’s all be part of the solution with every meal we take and together hold our governments and corporations accountable for protecting public health and the health of the planet so we can make scandals like this a story of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

Logs from deforestation alongside young palm plants outside Long Noran village, East Kalimantan. Bukit Subur Estate with palm tree plantation and forest is in the background. Deforestation is driving climate change and pushing endangered species to the brink of extinction. According to recent estimates, Indonesia is the third largest greenhouse gas polluter of any nation on the planet, largely due to the destruction of its rainforest and peatlands. Clearing massive tracts of forest also has a major impact on wildlife diversity, and creates social conflict with indigenous communities.

				&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p class="normal"&gt;There's been a major development in our campaign to protect Indonesia's forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;IOI, one of the largest palm oil traders in the world, has just made &lt;a class="zoom" href="http://www.ioigroup.com/Content/NEWS/NewsroomDetails?intNewsID=837" target="_blank"&gt;a significant commitment to protect rainforests&lt;/a&gt;. If put into practice, this would address the problems on the company's own plantations and set new standards for the whole industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;This fantastic result comes after many years of campaigning by Greenpeace supporters, who persuaded big brands to stop buying palm oil from IOI until it showed it was serious about safeguarding forests. Pressure from people around the world was instrumental in pushing IOI towards these new commitments that go well beyond what other traders have agreed to. All eyes are now on them to follow IOI's lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="A Greenpeace investigator documents the devastation of a company-identified 'No Go' area of peatland in the PT Bumi Sawit Sejahtera (IOI) oil palm concession in Ketapang, West Kalimantan. This area of the concession suffered extensive fires in 2015." src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/community_images/84/2284/135452_241137.jpg" alt="A Greenpeace investigator documents the devastation of a company-identified 'No Go' area of peatland in the PT Bumi Sawit Sejahtera (IOI) oil palm concession in Ketapang, West Kalimantan.

This area of the concession suffered extensive fires in 2015.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losing customers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;IOI is the third-largest palm oil trader in the world, buying and selling from hundreds of other companies. It has its own landbanks in Indonesia and Malaysia where it had been replacing forests with plantations and coming into conflict with local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/media/reports/burning-up-borneo" target="_blank"&gt;Since 2008&lt;/a&gt;, we have been exposing how IOI has been linked to the destruction of valuable forest and peatland areas, exploitation of plantation workers including reports of child labour, and extensive fires on its land contributing to the thick pollution that often swathes large parts of Southeast Asia. And because IOI buys so much palm oil from hundreds of other growers and traders, it was linked to environmental and social problems happening on land controlled by those companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;Over the years, IOI has produced a string of commitments about ending the destruction, but none of them were properly implemented and failed to make a difference on the ground. Then in March 2016, IOI was &lt;a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2016/03/malaysian-palm-oil-giant-ioi-suspended-from-rspo/" target="_blank"&gt;suspended&lt;/a&gt; by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) following a complaint by environmental organisation Aidenvironment, which meant it could no longer call any of its palm oil 'sustainable'. IOI even &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/09/top-palm-oil-producer-sues-green-group-over-deforestation-allegations" target="_blank"&gt;sued the RSPO&lt;/a&gt; about the suspension, although later dropped the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="The Greenpeace thermal airship A.E. Bates flies over the San Francisco Bay area near a facility where palm oil trader IOI imports its palm oil in the San Francisco Bay area.

&lt;p class="normal"&gt;Many of its major customers, such as Unilever and Nestlé, &lt;a class="zoom" href="http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2016/03/31/ioi-palm-trader-suspended/" target="_blank"&gt;stopped buying from IOI&lt;/a&gt; and refused to go back even when the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/08/palm-oil-giant-ioi-group-regains-rspo-sustainability-certification" target="_blank"&gt;RSPO suspension was lifted&lt;/a&gt; a few months later. Some companies needed more persuading - General Mills, makers of Betty Crocker cake mixes, were happy to continue trading with IOI until &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/general-mills-forest-sustainable-palm-oil-ioi-rspo/" target="_blank"&gt;thousands of Greenpeace supporters emailed the CEO&lt;/a&gt; to point out how irresponsible this was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/27/greenpeace-blockades-ioi-palm-oil-refinery-rotterdam-port" target="_blank"&gt;activists blockaded IOI's refinery in Rotterdam&lt;/a&gt;, it was to remind the big brand companies that it was still a palm oil provider they should avoid. And delivering 300,000 signatures from around the world to their head offices in Kuala Lumpur took the campaign right to the company's front door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="Greenpeace activists close off access for all imports and exports from palm oil trader IOI in the harbour of Rotterdam, palm oil’s gateway into Europe." src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/community_images/84/2284/135447_241133.jpg" alt="Greenpeace activists close off access for all imports and exports from palm oil trader IOI in the harbour of Rotterdam, palm oil’s gateway into Europe."&gt;Greenpeace activists close off access for all imports and exports from palm oil trader IOI in the harbour of Rotterdam, palm oil’s gateway into Europe, in September 2016.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wider impacts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;Losing such big customers put IOI under enormous pressure and was instrumental in bringing about this change in direction. But if so many previous commitments have not been fulfilled, why should this time be any different?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;Today's announcement goes much further than anything IOI has promised before. It has said it will commission independent verification of how well forests and the rights of workers and communities are being protected on its own land. IOI has also committed to resolve long-standing conflicts with local communities and respect the rights of plantation workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;One of the most important points is that IOI will be actively monitoring its suppliers to ensure they too are safeguarding forests and people. Any company selling palm oil to IOI will need to prove it is protecting forests, so the impacts should spread far beyond IOI's own operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;The big prize here is that IOI will be able to put pressure on the other big palm oil traders - Wilmar, Musim Mas, Golden Agri Resources and others - to step up their efforts. The traders sell palm oil to each other and other traders will need to interrogate their own suppliers to ensure IOI does not receive dirty palm oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;Deforestation is still a huge problem for the palm oil industry and the traders need to act immediately to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains. They need to publish their own rigorous plans showing how they will screen their suppliers and cut off those that are continuing to destroy forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;The proof, as always, is in how well these promises are put into practice. There is still a lot of work to do before IOI is completely free from deforestation. We will be monitoring progress closely and won’t hesitate to challenge IOI if we think it’s not keeping its word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;Right now, enormous thanks must go to everyone around the world who helped achieve this important breakthrough and brought an end to deforestation in Indonesia that little bit closer. &lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;img title="Traffic jam in Bangkok, Thailand" src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/137276_245511.jpg" alt="traffic jam, transport "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Every morning, as I walk to the subway to go to class, a couple old Route 54 buses would roll by, leaving behind a cloud of black exhaust  for me and everyone else to inhale. Each and every time, it leaves me wondering, “what could possibly be in the air we breathe everyday?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you walk, drive or commute, you will definitely notice the air quality, or lack thereof. We seem to be getting less and less clean air everyday, especially in Bangkok where many have probably forgotten how it is to breathe fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most harmful &lt;a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/vehicles-air-pollution-and-human-health/cars-trucks-air-pollution#.WUNvXLZLeUk"&gt;substances&lt;/a&gt; in our atmosphere, as I've learned, is &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1827&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=54953&amp;amp;ea.tracking.id=Planet3"&gt;PM2.5&lt;/a&gt;-- particulate matter that is smaller than 2.5 micrometers. That’s a quarter of a diameter of a single strand of human hair, definitely smaller than what the naked eye can see. Now try to imagine how that tiny particle makes its way through your nostrils and into the lungs every time you step outside your home.  Just because you don’t see these tiny pollutants, doesn’t mean it will not affect you. In the long run, it can weaken one's immune system, damage the respiratory system which may lead to coughing, choking, having reduced lung capacity, and even blockage of oxygen to your vital organs. At worse, it can lead to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of a friend, I embarked on a journey to find out how Bangkok people deal with the problem of air pollution.  Using a portable monitoring device provided by Greenpeace, we went around to measure PM2.5 present in various locations across the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO), air quality measurements are typically reported in terms of daily or annual mean concentrations of PM10 particles per cubic meter of air volume (m3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also referred to the &lt;a href="https://www3.epa.gov/airnow/aqi_brochure_02_14.pdf"&gt;Air Quality Index&lt;/a&gt; (AQI), a standard that countries follow as it corresponds to national standards. In Bangkok's case, we used guidelines set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and by the China State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA), as Thailand’s &lt;a href="http://www.aqmthai.com/index.php"&gt;Pollution Control Department&lt;/a&gt; (PCD) has yet to incorporate PM2.5 into its AQI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href="https://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.aqi"&gt;USEPA&lt;/a&gt;, the AQI with values from 0-50 indicate good, 51-100 is moderate, 101-150 is unhealthy for sensitive groups, 151-200 is unhealthy, 201-300 is very unhealthy, and 301-500 is deemed hazardous. As for AQI based on &lt;a href="http://datadriven.yale.edu/air-quality-2/chinas-new-air-quality-index-how-does-it-measure-up/"&gt;SEPA&lt;/a&gt;, the values from 0-50 indicate excellent, 51-100 is good, 101-150 is slightly polluted, 151-200 is lightly polluted, 201-300 is moderately polluted, and anything over 300 means heavily polluted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/sm4cKeZL06bBzTSrWkk344uD1-x_SFtIwywipsjHoQsNyWC-quV--WpjGe18p6ANMjyduojIzw5-yTTQS_1Y4ROWt0aP7ZksTWQ44MfRYtWqCBXUQnaxn8vM_O2YQjLXnXQtMVu-" alt="IMG_3870.JPG" width="607" height="455"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After conducting our little monitoring exercise, what we found was not good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air quality at a green space like Lumpini Park seemed healthy at USEPA AQI = 25/SEPA AQI = 6, air from other places was not as pleasant. And while the air inside a BTS skytrain was USEPA = 50/SEPA AQI = 12, air from the air-conditioned Terminal 21 mall was poorer at USEPA AQI = 63/SEPA AQI = 27. It was as bad as the open-air corridors of Siam Square, with AQI USEPA AQI = 73/SEPA AQI = 35. Even on the 14th floor of a building in the Chulalongkorn campus, USEPA AQI = 63/SEPA AQI = 22 was measured. In fact, being in any of these three locations could be as bad as standing by the road intersection at Asok, which measured USEPA AQI = 63/SEPA AQI = 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QBl0fM1HJUGLnis6PY5KbPW4WqQO3n65EYkg7Y0dL90loJUyqkEmmvRxC-FWE05pRPo2lW3Nj384-9MCGM2IeS1Ib1aB2k1KoW7Avb13pQX3269Qq1v_o2hk03cFT1t0iVdP5Ck7" alt="IMG_3884.JPG" width="616" height="462"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The air at Pratunam is worse, it stings my nose,” says Kajornsuk Suebsuk, a motorcycle taxi driver around Siam Square.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we had already braced ourselves for bigger numbers in areas with visible smog, we were not prepared for the results at Hua Chang Pier. Though our device indicated pollution at USEPA AQI = 185/SEPA AQI = 85 and PM2.5 of 70 μg/m3 at times the klong was clear, it peaked with USEPA AQI = 449/SEPA AQI = 500 and PM2.5 to 420 μg/m3 when a passenger boat came by and left behind a trail of black exhaust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6ReMD29j5SfY29nIIszH15ACsGTjgdcfk1SRvnQ5rVBNpv7d1ZkcTI-KPLULEh7qCDv46U5c7BZDsT3BusvTFGwzE1XOz83yLWpYjIeSzlvPrzyXt4t-AMIsQTZG9hSnnlufVmFs" alt="IMG_3873.JPG" width="610" height="460"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think if I had to walk, I’d rather walk by the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;klong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; because the wind is much better. The road looks and feels more cramped-- with the smell, noise,” said Adul Gornjan, a boat service staff at Klong Saen Saep. It is scary to think, that a huge fraction of Bangkok’s population use these boats for their daily commute, and many seem unaware of the dangers they face everyday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here comes the most shocking part. At the well-known Erawan Shrine, popular among both locals and tourists, values on the device maxed out at USEPA/SEPA AQI = 500 due to smoke from incense and candles. PM2.5 was measured at a choking 674 μg/m3 and even reached 900 at one point. Now that is deadly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Y6Ag80s6Oz76Al8U5YFRTLzTvp4JMItKwhq9a9QpbjQRwnZ_cQf29vpuMvmp-fKu5PVXKo1lEi05JxQvW1XlpxGA_a7fs1UJkmeU02uorFpF5xWAV7EqyizEFjERk7UM6wQvmOUM" alt="IMG_3888.JPG" width="624" height="468"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All the results mentioned were part of fluctuating values observed at each location, taken between late in the morning and afternoon of a single day, following heavy rainfall from the previous night. Usually, accurate data on air quality requires averaging measurements of not only pollutants, but also several other &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www3.epa.gov/ttnamti1/files/ambient/pm25/qa/QA-Handbook-Vol-II.pdf"&gt;&lt;span&gt;factors and conditions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; throughout a specific period--including time, time span, frequency, temperature, weather, wind speed and direction, location, human bias and errors, and equipment calibration-- all need to be considered so as to ensure information that best represents the overall AQI. For this reason, the Pollution Control Department's expertise and resources play a crucial role in the well-being of all Thais.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;“What the government could do is enforce more and stricter regulations to limit the use of resources that would contribute to pollution. Sometimes encouragement campaigns don’t work because Thais like to break rules,” says Adiruj Punja, a skytrain passenger, who believes Bangkok’s current air quality “damages his mental health”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 61 monitoring stations set across 29 provinces in Thailand, only 14 of those stations in 14 provinces are installed with PM2.5 monitors. Already eight of these monitors show annual averages that exceed &lt;a href="http://greenpeace.or.th/s/right-to-clean-air/PM2.5CityRankingsREV.pdf"&gt;Thai AQI guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, which is 25 μg/m3 or 2.5 times higher than that of WHO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PM2.5 is emitted from a wide range of human activities from fuel combustion from vehicles, power plants, and industrial processes, to cooking, smoking, burning trash, and chemical reactions in the atmosphere. The pollution can remain in the atmosphere for a prolonged period of time, regardless of its chemical composition-- think mercury, cadmium, arsenic, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Furthermore, these particles are known to be formed in or travel far from its original source. Now we know that what happens in Bangkok, doesn’t stay in Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the air pollution that kills&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/06/pollution-now-greater-threat-ebola-hiv-world-health-organisation/"&gt; 6.5 million people&lt;/a&gt; around the world annually, these pollutants pose an extremely serious threat to human health on a global scale. This reason alone should be enough to justify the need for the &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1827&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=54953&amp;amp;ea.tracking.id=Planet3"&gt;PCD to install PM2.5 monitors in all stations across Thailand, as well as upgrade the country’s AQI to incorporate the pollutant&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By doing so, the PCD would not only provide Thais with proper and complete information on air quality, but also enable them to effectively protect themselves from air pollution. Furthermore, the reports would serve not only the purpose creating of public awareness, but can also act as a standard which PM2.5 producers can use to reduce their emissions based on the given assessments and guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While individuals now have access to ways to &lt;a href="http://aqicn.org/city/bangkok/"&gt;measure air quality&lt;/a&gt; as a result of present-day technological advances, it should be the responsibility of governments to provide its citizens with information on the living standards that the country offers. After all, we have the right to know what we breathe, and most importantly, the &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1827&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=54953&amp;amp;ea.tracking.id=Planet3"&gt;right to clean air&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Just as Facebook has revolutionized the way the world communicates, so it can revolutionize the IT sector's current reliance on coal. Facebook's reputation for innovation means that wherever it goes, other IT companies will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Facebook's two new massive new data centresdue to be switched on soon, each of which uses enough power to light up tens of thousands of homes, there’s never been a better time for Facebook to unfriend coal and choose the renewable energy future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Countdown to Earth Day, April 22:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've challenged Facebook to pledge to go green by Earth Day. With less than 25 days to go, will Facebook step up? To keep the pressure on, we need your help to make sure that as many people as possible watch and share this video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk3yBpV8Pac"&gt;Share on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; (or click the twitter button on the left to share this on twitter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Got a blog or website?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a blog or website, you could help by linking to the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk3yBpV8Pac" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook TV Ad&lt;/a&gt; video with the link text just as I have done in this sentence. Please use "Facebook TV Ad" as the link text, in a sentence about Facebook's coal problem. If enough websites participate, our video will soon be the first thing that people find when searching the web for, well, a Facebook TV ad.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are we on the cusp of changing the destructive seafood industry forever?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-family: Tahoma, 'MS Sans Serif', Arial, Geneva, Helvetica;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0px; white-space: nowrap;"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/136172_242879.jpg" alt="Activists on the MY Esperanza confront Supply Vessel Explorer II in the Indian Ocean"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greenpeace activists peacefully confront marine operations at the heart of Thai Union’s supply chain in 2016. Activists in inflatable boats delivered a cease and desist letter to the deck of the Explorer II, a supply vessel using an underwater seamount to perch on and contribute to massive depletion of ocean life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, the seafood industry has &lt;a href="https://www.ap.org/explore/seafood-from-slaves/" target="_blank"&gt;profited from forced labour&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/24/world/the-outlaw-ocean.html" target="_blank"&gt;illegal fishing&lt;/a&gt;, ocean destruction and the needless slaughter of marine life. Tuna vessels operate out of sight and get away with just about anything on the high seas. Many times, the companies selling our families tuna have no idea where their fish came from or who caught it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tuna.greenpeace.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Our campaign taking on Thai Union&lt;/a&gt;, the largest canned tuna company in the world, is about so much more than just tuna. It is about changing the entire seafood industry. We know that if we can shift the largest canned tuna company in the world, the rest of the industry will be forced to change as well. The status quo is no longer acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two years of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/press/releases/2016/Esperanza-protest-overfishing-Thai-Union/" target="_blank"&gt;activists and consumers demanding better from the company&lt;/a&gt;, Thai Union is talking to Greenpeace and looking into ways to clean up its operations. The company is considering changes that could significantly reduce the use of destructive fishing methods, help  minimise the risk of labour abuse in its supply chains, address illegal fishing and overfishing, and ensure the traceability of its seafood from ship to plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are monumental changes that will signal to the rest of the industry that it must do better or get left behind. The question is: is Thai Union and its brands ready to lead the industry in a new direction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="600" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EaORpPx4QJg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why, in our latest video, famous internet cats, mermaids, sharks, turtles, and humans alike are pushing Thai Union for action. We need everyone to speak up -- and push for the urgent reforms that are so desperately needed. There’s no longer time for baby steps or half measures. We need the sweeping changes that Thai Union is considering for our oceans and the workers at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thai Union is massive -- owning brands like Chicken of the Sea (US), Mareblu (Italy), John West (North Europe and Middle East), Petit Navire (France) and Sealect (Thailand). The company also supplies retailers, pet food brands, and foodservice companies around the world, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/greenpeace-walmart-canned-tuna_us_5730d52ee4b096e9f092293c" target="_blank"&gt;including retail giant Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. These changes will stretch far and wide, which is why it’s so important we win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t let this opportunity pass us by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1844&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=42721" target="_blank"&gt;Join with Lil Bub, Hannah Mermaid, and activists around the globe in demanding a better seafood industry immediately&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            To ensure fish for the future

Popularly known as poor man’s fish in my country due to its abundance hence affordability, the Galunggong in my mind is being pan-fried and served with brown rice and fresh tomatoes. I think my daydreaming of the local fish was a sub-conscious reaction. I learned from Dr. Perry Alino, a professor of the University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute and a member of the Philippine delegation to this meeting that the Philippines is now importing Galunggong and other fishes formerly plentiful in its seas and rivers. The causes of decline in the supply and quality of staple fishes are varied. They include overfishing, destructive fishing practices, pollution, seabed mining and other extractive activities, that are happening—take note-- in the high and deep seas or areas beyond national waters. Global warming has also adversely impacted the world’s oceans increasing the water acidity and threatening coral reefs and certain marine organisms. What’s happening in the remote and deep parts of the oceans that are outside any country’s jurisdiction is affecting the supply and quality of our sea food, and ultimately the economic and social conditions of the people.It is quite timely that world governments recently gathered for the UN 3rd Preparatory Committee Meeting on the International Legally Binding Instrument for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biodiversity beyond Areas of National Jurisdiction. Top on the agenda was how to address the numerous problems in those key areas.One of the solutions to restore the sustaining capacity of oceans is the establishment of marine protected areas and marine reserves.A Marine Protected Area (MPA) is a designated area managed for particular objectives, ranging from no-take marine reserves or marine sanctuaries with regulated use. Think of it as a sanctuary, where fishing is off limits to help fish live and breed. MPAs are one entry point for fisheries management. According to Professor Doug McCauley from the University of California Sta. Barbara, studies show that fishes in MPAs are more and bigger, and more and bigger fishes produce more and bigger baby fishes. This is consistent with the lessons learned from MPAs in the Philippines and in other parts of Southeast Asia that show increase in the fish population and resilience in the protected areas.Thus, in this process in New York, governments must set up a robust, transparent, inclusive and science based process for the creation, implementation and enforcement of a global representative network of interconnected MPAs including marine reserves in waters beyond national jurisdiction, thus filling the last massive gap in ocean governance. Greenpeace has suggested a process on how this could work in practice. Amazingly, this UN process, seemingly far and irrelevant to our everyday typical life in Southeast Asia will eventually have a concrete and proximate impact on our lives, on our social and economic conditions, and on our Galunggong and other staple fishes. Atty.

				&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Yu Patmi (48 years old) was an ordinary village woman. But there was nothing ordinary in her determined struggle to defend her home village in Kendeng Highland in Central Java against destruction by cement industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/135150_240374.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She came to Jakarta a couple of weeks ago with dozens other men and women from Kendeng to stage a courageous protest in front of the Presidential Palace. They buried their foot in concrete for eight consecutive days. They had to end their protest on the ninth day because Yu Patmi did not survive a heart attack on that day. They had to bring her body back home and bury her in her village. She sacrificed her life for the struggle for our common future. In a materialistic and individualistic world that we have today her death teach us a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the struggle of the Kendeng people, Yu Patmi and her compatriots, remind me one of the very principles of the environmental movement. It is about the people, first and foremost. Their struggle to defend the Kendeng Highland, their home and livelihood, represent the very essence of environmental and social movement, a struggle for justice and survival.  And what they have been facing in the past five years are blatant complicity and intertwine between the power of state and capital, which is the source of complete ignorance to the aspiration of peasants like the Kendeng people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, we environmental activists are so used to grey areas. Myriads of policy discussions, policy advocacy works, lobbying and negotiation, as well as engagement with the millenials, have blurred the line between what needs to be done and what’s just nice to have. The struggle of the Kendeng people is a hard reminder of the naked truth of power that we are facing. A reminder that at the end of the day, the struggles of the oppressed working people like the late Yu Patmi and her compatriots from Kendeng, should be at the very core of our environmental movement.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/135151_240380.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/135149_240376.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, broad based coalition like we have been seeing in the past couple weeks supporting the Kendeng people, is a precious social capital that we must continue nurturing. In the days of silo mentalities that we have now, Yu Patmi and Kendeng people teach us a lot about collaboration and solidarity. They, without much talking, teach us about how to work together, how to develop strategy together, and most importantly how to break our silos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One very important lesson for me is that whatever issues we are fighting for, we should be able to bring it to the reality of people’s daily life. In this Kendeng case, the complexity of relations between the ecological position of Kendeng Highland and the carrying capacity of Java, need to be communicated as narrative alongside the main narrative, which is the survival of the Kendeng people. The broad based civil society coalition that we have today would not have been possible had we not have the Kendeng people’s future as the main narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/135152_240382.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, that the potential of linking the complexity of Climate Change issues, and our Break Free objectives to end coal domination, with people struggle such as in agrarian conflicts in Kendeng and elsewhere is real. We just need to think very strategically about the issues, at the same time humble in our approach and like what discussed earlier if we break down our silos, others will break down theirs and we can have big solidarity movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case of Kendeng, a couple of weeks ago I deliberately decided that Greenpeace Indonesia should join the Coalition. While people may not be able to automatically link the issue, I saw that there is natural link at least between the Kendeng people struggle and the Batang people struggle against the single largest coal-fired power plant in Southeast Asia, which we have been supporting for the past six years. They are both located in the northern part of Central Java, both communities are peasants (and fisher folks in the case of Batang), they face quite similar complicity between the power of the state and capital, and at the very core of both struggle is the survival of lives and livelihoods of the people as well as the sustainability of their ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The massive proliferation of cement industry in Java (24 new cement factories are now in the pipe line to be constructed only in the northern part of Java) must be one of the key reasons for projection of massive increase of electricity demand for Java. The government always says that this massive electricity demand can only be supplied by massive proliferation of coal-fired power plants, one of them is the Batang power plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, 23 March 2017, Batang sent the largest delegate to the Break Free mass action in Jakarta. In the afternoon of that day the Break Free mass went to the area in front of the Presidential Palace to synergize and collaborate with the Action to support Kendeng’s people struggle. It was a beautiful day for the movement, when different affected communities with different cases, and activists from different organisations, break down their silos and formed big solidarity for both Kendeng case and Coal Free future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are enough reasons and certainly there is a need for broad based solidarity for our common future, a healthier earth and sustainable livelihoods for the people. Yu Patmi sacrificed her live for those objectives, and we should make sure that was not done in vain.&lt;/p&gt;

This marks a major shift for the corporation, and sends a signal to the entire fishing industry to do better for the oceans and seafood industry workers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 9.0pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-left: 0cm; line-height: 13.5pt; background: white; outline-style: none; font-stretch: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"&gt;&lt;img title='Greenpeace volunteers label John West tuna cans with "THIS IS NOT JUST TUNA" in a Tesco store to raise awareness of the #JustTuna campaign.' src="/international/community_images/84/2284/137053_244980.jpg" alt="tuna cans by Thai Union" width="600" height="450"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 9.0pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-left: 0cm; line-height: 13.5pt; background: white; outline-style: none; font-stretch: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;How did this happen?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the world’s biggest tuna producer, one in five cans of tuna sold globally are canned by Thai Union. Greenpeace’s global campaign to transform the tuna industry has included targeting its brands for several years through &lt;a href="http://tuna.greenpeace.org/info/greenpeace-tuna-guides/" target="_blank"&gt;tuna rankings&lt;/a&gt;, along with assessments of foodservice companies, supermarkets, and other brands supplied by the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost two years ago, we &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/greenpeace-urges-consumers-and-investors-around-the-globe-to-avoid-thai-union-group-canned-tuna/" target="_blank"&gt;launched a global campaign&lt;/a&gt;, calling on Thai Union to bring the tuna industry out of the shadows where a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/world/outlaw-ocean-thailand-fishing-sea-slaves-pets.html" target="_blank"&gt;cycle of overexploitation&lt;/a&gt;, devastation and &lt;a href="https://www.ap.org/explore/seafood-from-slaves/" target="_blank"&gt;appalling labour practices flourish in the name of profit&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside our allies, unions, concerned members of the public and our supporters, we pushed the company toward a brighter future for our oceans, seafood workers and ocean-dependent communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/press/releases/2016/Esperanza-protest-overfishing-Thai-Union/" target="_blank"&gt;our ships on the high seas&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://storify.com/greenpeace/notjusttuna-taking-on-the-largest-canned-tuna-comp" target="_blank"&gt;supermarkets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GreenpeaceTuna/status/844194771145056256" target="_blank"&gt;industry conferences&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/Nearly-700000-people-call-on-Thai-Union-for-more-sustainable-ethical-tuna/" target="_blank"&gt;company headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, thousands of people including massive labour unions and human rights organizations joined our call for Thai Union to source more sustainably and responsibly. Together, we pushed companies supplied by Thai Union to sell better products and commit to policies that help workers and our oceans, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/press/releases/2017/Mars-Nestle-commit-to-clean-up-pet-food-supply-chains-increasing-pressure-on-Thai-Union-to-act/" target="_blank"&gt;including tackling practices like transshipment that fuel illegal activity and human rights abuses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Greenpeace activists delivered a global petition, representing over 680,000 individuals, calling on Thai Union for more sustainable tuna." src="/international/community_images/84/2284/137055_244976.jpg" alt="Activists, petition delivery" width="600" height="399"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So how has Thai Union changed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the mounting pressure, starting immediately, the company will begin making the following &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/Global/international/documents/oceans/Thai-Union-Commitments.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;changes across its global business&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/a-bad-kind-of-fad-the-fish-magnet-thats-not-so-sexy/" target="_blank"&gt;fish aggregating device (FAD)&lt;/a&gt; use by an average of 50%, and double supply of verifiable FAD-free caught fish globally by 2020. FADs are floating objects that create mini ecosystems and result in the catch and killing of many marine species, including sharks, turtles, and juvenile tuna.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift significant portions of longline caught tuna to best practice pole and line or troll caught tuna by 2020 and implement strong requirements in place to help reduce bycatch. Longline vessels are known for catching and killing non-target species like seabirds, turtles, and sharks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend its current moratorium on &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/transhipment-tuna-pacific-fishing/blog/53914/" target="_blank"&gt;at-sea transshipment &lt;/a&gt;across its entire global supply chain unless strict conditions are met by suppliers. Transshipment at sea enables vessels to continue fishing for months or years at a time and facilitates illegal activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure independent observers are present on all longline vessels transshipping at sea to inspect and report on potential labour abuse, and ensure human or electronic observer coverage across all tuna longline vessels it sources from. Much of the abuse that plagues fishing vessels takes place out of sight without authorities to report to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a comprehensive code of conduct for all vessels in its supply chains to help ensure workers at sea are being treated humanely and fairly, beginning in January 2018.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An audit will be conducted by an independent third party next year to measure progress, and in the meantime, we will all be watching and waiting for positive results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Greenpeace crew retrieve a FAD in the Indian Ocean" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/community_images/84/2284/137054_244978.jpg" alt="FADs, Indian Ocean" width="600" height="399"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Calling on other major tuna buyers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thai Union cannot and should not be taking this on alone. Not only will the vessels catching the fish need to fully cooperate for these commitments to turn into real action and positive change, but all major buyers and sellers of tuna need to recognize that the status quo is no longer acceptable. Supporting more sustainable and socially responsible fisheries, particularly those that are small-scale, is an essential part of any sound tuna sourcing policy. Customers should not have to choose between bad or better, all tuna should be responsibly-caught to help address the oceans’ overfishing crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thai Union’s commitment is not the end of the story to transform the fishing industry, but the continuation of a growing movement to stop out of control companies from wreaking havoc on ocean ecosystems and people’s lives. We need to continue to hold companies accountable and all do our part to reduce the threats to our oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;It was a hot and humid morning in Bangkok but that didn’t stop me from running almost 4 kms in a tuna costume with 20 fellow activists to Thai Union’s headquarters in Bangkok. Was I crazy? Was I hallucinating? No. Over 680,000 consumers from over 130 countries and territories around the world had a message to deliver to Thai Union, urging the company to step forward as a leader on sourcing more sustainable and socially responsible canned tuna, and I was proud to be part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Nearly 700,000 people call on Thai Union for more sustainable, ethical tuna." src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/136289_243165.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passing the torch from consumers to Thai Union&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey did not begin today. It has been a long run -- a marathon. For the last two years, we have been asking the world’s largest tuna company to take the steps needed to be a leader in ensuring its products and supply chains are free from human rights abuses and destructive, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing practices. Now we want to see its true leadership and commitment toward making real changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This run brought together the hopes of activists around the globe to see commitments that will help protect our oceans, workers at sea and marine life. As we were passing the torch from hand to hand, we also passed the global petition signatures from people who do not want our seafood connected to serious human rights abuse, overfishing, and destructive fishing methods that kill sharks, seabirds and turtles. As one of the largest companies in the seafood industry, Thai Union has the power to move the destructive tuna industry in a better direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past two years, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/fighting-for-sustainable-tuna-thai-union/blog/54591/"&gt;consumers and activists around the globe&lt;/a&gt;, spanning across the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/mermaid-activist-delivers-strong-message-on-ocean-conservation-at-chicken-of-the-sea-headquarters/"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-new-zealand/en/press/Greenpeace-shuts-down-Whiskas-factory-after-slavery-connection-confirmed/"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.fr/action-sur-lusine-petit-navire-de-douarnenez/"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/greenpeaceseath/videos/10153723369512098/"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, have pressured Thai Union to demand that the company make meaningful changes that protect the oceans and industry workers. Consumers have more power than they realise. From sea to shelf, their purchasing decisions can help redefine the fishing market and industry. With increased demand for sustainable seafood options, foodservice companies, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/greenpeace-u-s-retailers-show-improvement-on-responsibly-sourced-canned-tuna-but-big-brands-continue-to-hold-the-industry-back/"&gt;big supermarket chains and, brands in the US&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/tesco-john-west-tuna-greenpeace-ellie-goulding-trawler-line-caught-sustainability-a7156126.html"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tuna.greenpeace.org/stories/towards-justtuna-how-a-big-canadian-brand-is-working-to-clean-up-its-sourcing/"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-02/australian-tuna-brands-change-to-sustainable-fishing/6439010"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, Germany and beyond are finally offering customers more sustainable and ethical product options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Nearly 700,000 people call on Thai Union for more sustainable, ethical tuna." src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/136290_243167.jpg" alt="TU tuna run in Bangkok (June 2017)"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason we ran today was to show Thai Union that we are waiting for the significant reforms that could reduce its reliance on destructive fishing methods like longlines and purse seiners employing fish aggregating devices (FADs) that contribute to overfishing and the needless killing of vulnerable marine life. Greenpeace is also calling on Thai Union to reduce the risk of human rights abuses and unsustainable fish in its supply chains. We are urging the company to increase independent human observer coverage on fishing vessels, ensure the traceability of fish from sea to plate, support best practice fisheries to immediately reduce its ecological impact on our oceans, and tackle transshipment at sea -- a practice that enables vessels to stay at sea for months or years at a time with workers away from watchful eyes. You may not see it now, but the result of this hard work is to ensure that our seafood is sustainable for future generations and does not devastate ocean-dependent people and our oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The race toward more sustainable and ethical canned tuna is not over&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;From consumers to company, we delivered petition signatures to &lt;span&gt;Dr. Darian McBain, Group Director of Sustainable Development for Thai Union&lt;/span&gt;, and encouraged the company to listen to the hundreds of thousands of consumers and activists demanding better tuna. Following almost two years of Greenpeace campaigning on Thai Union, the company is considering important steps that could help transform the seafood industry forever. The activists held banners that read, “Over 680,000 people want Thai Union to lead.” The voice of consumers and ocean lovers is loud and clear. We want Thai Union and its brands to make meaningful changes to protect the oceans and industry workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s run has finished. Our collective voice was delivered to the company’s doorsteps, but this is far from over. Now is not the time to quit the race toward more sustainable and ethical tuna. We have come so far and have 680,000 people behind us, but we need to continue pushing Thai Union to act. If Thai Union leads for change, the rest of seafood industry must follow. The oceans don’t belong to industrial fishing companies, they belong to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

            Preventing and Extinguishing Fires For Forests Without Fires

The disaster in Sumatra and Kalimantan led to the destruction of around 2.6 million hectares of forests and peatlands, causing 103,000 premature deaths of people in the region and increasing the Orangutans’ risk of extinction. This alarming issue has yet to be addressed and forest fires are still a big threat for Indonesia.&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			
				&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p class="normal"&gt;The forest fire crisis of 2015, one of the worst crises in Indonesia’s history is still fresh in our memory. The disaster in Sumatra and Kalimantan led to the destruction of around 2.6 million hectares of forests and peatlands, causing 103,000 premature deaths of people in the region and increasing the Orangutans’ risk of extinction. This alarming issue has yet to be addressed and &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-indonesia/press/releases/Pemerintah-Belum-Cukup-Melindungi-Hutan-dan-Gambut/"&gt;forest fires are still a big threat for Indonesia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/138458_248418.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;During the Paris Climate Change Conference in 2015, President Joko Widodo announced Indonesia’s commitment to mitigate climate change through several measures including the reduction of environmentally-detrimental emissions by 29% before 2030 and 41% with international support.[2]. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;The President’s commitment must be supported with concrete measures. All stakeholders have to be involved in order to meet the commitment of the emission reduction target. Greenpeace has launched a campaign called Forests Without Fires as our contribution to addressing this issue. The campaign, aims at preventing and suppressing forest and peat lands fires to protect our remaining forest and peat lands, government transparency for natural resource data as well as calling for good governance and strong law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/138459_248420.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;In 2016, Greenpeace has formed a Forest Fire Prevention (FFP) team that consists of young volunteers and former victims of forest fires and haze who are willing to take action to reduce and mitigate the risk of forest fires and haze. The Team’s task is not easy as the characteristics of peat fires differ from those of land fires. Fire hotspots commonly caused by peat burning underground. It is the main reason why peatlands should not be dried out this will help to avoid potential fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;Unfortunately, since the establishment of palm oil and acacia plantation industries, peatlands are dried out by the digging of massive canals, designed to dry the peat and enable commodity expansion. Greenpeace has called out these industries and are demanding they dam or block these canals in order to maintain the peat land in its natural state, restore the areas impacted and reduce the risk of fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;Referring to its name, prevention is the central focus of the team’s priority. They are specifically trained to detect fires and put them out before they cause dangerous, widespread fires. In addition to this main task, the team is also assigned to conduct other activities, such as the investigation of potential fires in the field, raising awareness on the importance of forest and peatlands protection for the local communities and extinguishing fires whenever needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;The team is not working alone. They are working together with a special fire fighting team from the Ministry of Forestry and Environment (Manggala Agni), local communities and local NGOs on the ground and supported by Greenpeace Russia’s forest fire experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/138460_248422.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;In 2016, the FFP team took action to prevent and suppress fires in Rantau Bais, Tanah Putih, Districts of Rokan Hilir, Riau and this year, the team will take action in the Sungai Putri landscape and the surrounding area, a critical peat landscape which hosts important habitat for Orangutans in West Kalimantan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;Let’s support Greenpeace and the Forest Fire Prevention team by actively raising our voice to demand &lt;a title="Ask President Joko Widodo" href="http://bit.ly/ForestNotFires"&gt;President Joko Widodo to take more serious measures to protect Indonesia’s forests and peatlands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/page/13663/petition/1?&amp;amp;locale=en-gb"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class="Apple-interchange-newline"&gt;It may not be obvious but I love to eat. However, participating in the Food for Life campaigns of Greenpeace and being a part of &lt;a href="https://greenmindedryan.wordpress.com/2015/12/01/iamhampaslupa-for-food-sovereignty-and-food-sufficiency/"&gt;#IAmHampasLupa&lt;/a&gt;, a group that advocates for mindful consumption among Filipinos, made me put more effort into choosing the food that I eat. After all, “&lt;a href="https://greenmindedryan.wordpress.com/2016/12/01/you-are-what-you-eat/"&gt;You are what you eat&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://greenmindedryan.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/okjaposterheader.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image by NETFLIX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“…This is the tenderloin for the sophisticated restaurants. The Mexicans love the feet. I know, go figure! We all love the face and the anus, as American as apple pie! Hot dogs. It’s all edible. All edible, except the squeal.” -Nancy Mirando, Okja&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;I watched &lt;em&gt;Food, Inc. (2008), Super Size Me (2004), Okja (2017)&lt;/em&gt;, and other documentaries, films, and Youtube videos related to food. I also read articles and books, and participated in advocacy events that further discussed the topic. I know, it seemed like I was brainwashing myself but aren’t we supposed to be concerned about stuff that goes into our bodies? Well, from all these so-called “indoctrination,” I came up with the following (obvious) conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a broken food system. We are disconnected from nature, and the food that we eat- we don’t know how it’s produced and where it comes from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processed food is bad news. But we know that already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporations, as always, are in control of the food available in the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don’t know the long-term effects of GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) but we’re probably eating them every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We eat more meat and less fruits and vegetables leading to health problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, you would be growing and cooking your own food. You would be buying local produce and would constantly check the label of products you buy. You wouldn’t be wasting food. Who does that anyway? &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/12/climate/100000005156004.mobile.html"&gt;Did you know that it’s the third best way of cutting greenhouse gases?&lt;/a&gt; And you would eat more fruits and veggies because aside from its health benefits, it can curb greenhouse gas emissions too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s stopping us from eating healthy? Let’s start from home. Busy parents have no time to cook and resort to the convenience of fast food takeaways and processed food. Kids get used to eating junk early on. And then these big corporations, which don’t really care about your well-being, offer the “best-tasting” food in the planet, with the demand further fueled by these #hugot-inspired advertisements. Witty as they appear to be, sometimes how corporations take advantage of values, relationships, and emotions as marketing ploy can be disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you live in the city, the readily available options you have are of course fast food and processed food yet again. Organic choices may not be that affordable to many but that begs the question, “How much value do you actually put on your food and yourself?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another eating habit issue is this notion that meat is normal, necessary, natural, and nice which drives us to consume more meat with less or no veggies at all. A &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/fruit/en/index2.html"&gt;2003 World Health Report&lt;/a&gt;, however, estimates that 1.7 million deaths worldwide is due to low consumption of fruits and vegetables. You don’t have to be a vegan or a vegetarian but health experts encourage a more plant-based diet for a healthier you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change and the environment, and animal welfare may not faze you in terms of your diet but if you want to live long, that should motivate you to give more thought to what you’re eating. Quite literally, it’s a matter of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;

            Producer responsibility: the key to solving Thailand’s plastic crisis

				&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/136818_244413.jpg" alt="plastic pollution"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A &lt;a href="http://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/17969/Plastic_waste_inputs_from_land_into_the_ocean.pdf?sequence=1&amp;amp;isAllowed=y"&gt;report from Science Magazine in 2015&lt;/a&gt; showed that Thailand is now among world’s biggest contributors of ocean waste. A shocking &lt;a href="https://oceanconservancy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/full-report-stemming-the.pdf"&gt;eight million tons of plastic enters the ocean every year&lt;/a&gt;, with a few countries, including Thailand, responsible for 60% of the amount. This causes environmental damage on a global scale and poses a serious threat to wildlife. An increasing number of marine animals are found either entangled in plastic debris, or with plastic trash ingested in their stomachs. Our very own Department of Marine and Coastal Resources say that &lt;a href="http://thaipublica.org/2017/03/waste-in-the-sea/"&gt;almost half of Thailand's ocean waste is plastic&lt;/a&gt;. This is not news, and despite concerns for the impact it has on the country’s tourism, have we done enough to address the issue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest solution is to the prevent the problem- by not creating waste in the first place. Another key factor is waste separation from the source. Both of these solutions require not only supervision from municipalities, but more importantly, cooperation from the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most practical approach to this issue, one which the Thai government will have to consider, is the ban of single-use plastics. Not only will this lead to “extended producer responsibility”- where producers of products are held more accountable and given more responsibility for the treatment or disposal of their consumer products, but will enable consumers to use their rights to demand for more environmentally-friendly products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the rules and regulations that the Thai government and people would have to embrace, the most crucial step in solving this plastic crisis is to change the industry mindset, as well as people’s consumption patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thailand’s plastic waste situation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="plastics pollution" src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/136819_244415.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://infofile.pcd.go.th/law/DraftWastePlan60-64.pdf?CFID=1835558&amp;amp;CFTOKEN=98563117"&gt;Plastic Waste Management Plan 2017-2021&lt;/a&gt;, Thailand produced up to 2.33 million tons of plastic in 2015. Despite claims that around 1.57 million tons was reused by communities and industries, there still remains a substantial amount of waste that is disposed both correctly and incorrectly. This stands as no surprise, as over the past decade, plastic waste has increased by 12%, or about two million tons every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thairath.co.th/content/417113"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2,490 waste management centers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; around the country and only 466 of them manage waste accordingly, using proper waste containment to prevent air and water contamination, as well as proper control over external factors such as preventing surface water from entering landfills. At least 200 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;rai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; of land is required for landfill management, costing up to 4,000-5,000 million baht per year just in Bangkok alone. In 2011, Thailand spent about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.voicetv.co.th/thailand/6341.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;12,000 million baht annually to manage 15 million tons of garbage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Imagine how much 26 million tons would cost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2015, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-Ocha has declared a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.isranews.org/isranews-scoop/39314-report03_39314.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;waste management budget of 20,000 million baht&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This included an annual budget of 3,000 million baht, with 373 million baht for waste management, 153 million baht for the construction of treatment plants, and 9 million baht towards promotion and broadcast for public involvement. This plan also called for a 220 baht service fee from each household.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the drafted plan presents a number of obstacles that the government has pinpointed, it  completely lacks specific, measurable objectives that directly address plastic reduction. Concerns mentioned include the design and production of plastic products (unindicated plastic type, missing recycle sign, absence of plastic substitutes, etc.) and consumption patterns (single usage, lack of waste separation, lack of information on recycling, etc.), the problem all comes down to policies not being put to serious use. As long as no laws are strictly imposed upon plastic use, there is no doubt the problem will persist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/136820_244417.jpg" alt="plastic pollution"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thailand must take heed and act with urgency to tackle its plastic waste pollution. This year, the government has finally proposed a new waste management plan, consisting of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://infofile.pcd.go.th/mgt/Pcd_plan60to64.pdf"&gt;&lt;span&gt;20-Year Pollution Management Strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Pollution Management Plan 2017-2021, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://infofile.pcd.go.th/waste/WasteMasterPlan.pdf?CFID=1804176&amp;amp;CFTOKEN=44874907"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Master Plan on Waste Management 2016-2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://infofile.pcd.go.th/law/DraftWastePlan60-64.pdf?CFID=1835558&amp;amp;CFTOKEN=98563117"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plastic Debris Management Plan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The strategy  aims to develop plastic management tools, promoting and encourage eco-packaging design and substitutes for plastic, implement the 3Rs (Reuse, Reduce, Recycle), and promote education on the issue. Meanwhile, immediate actions include removing marine litters, developing plastic waste reduction methods, conducting research on the situation and impact of plastic debris in marine environment, and establishing a national database of marine debris. Over the next few years, we can expect to see whether the commitment that the Thai government has promised will prove true and effective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If we don’t take action on these environmental issues, they will continue to impact our daily lives,  whether consuming seafood that ingested plastics, to drinking contaminated water , to experiencing floods due to clogged drainage. If this doesn’t make you think about the impact that all of us have on the issue, I don’t know what will.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a call raised by Greenpeace has already rounded up almost &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1827&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=58214&amp;amp;ea.tracking.id=blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=big-open-space&amp;amp;utm_source=greenpeace_th&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Oceans&amp;amp;utm_content=ocean,+plastic&amp;amp;utm_term=ocean,+plastic"&gt;60,000 people&lt;/a&gt; who have promised to engage in thoughtful consumption to tackle plastic waste pollution. Will you &lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1827&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=58214"&gt;join us to reclaim our environment&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

                    In 2015, global media exposed widespread human rights abuses, with links to US pet food brands and supermarkets, in Thailand’s overseas fishing industry. When authorities tried to tackle the problem the fishing companies simply shifted operations , to distant regions,  where it’s much harder for authorities to monitor and control, such as the fragile marine ecosystems of the Saya de Malha Bank in the Indian ocean. In 2016, Greenpeace Southeast Asia continued to investigate Thailand’s overseas fishing industry and seafood supply chains. 

Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s latest report, Turn the Tide outlines its investigations into IUU fishing, trafficking and other rights abuses– including multiple deaths at sea from beriberi, a disease caused by vitamin B1 deficiency, aboard Thai distant water fishing vessels operating in the Indian Ocean.

                    Thai overseas fishing fleets struck by an outbreak of Beriberi in early 2016.      

In January 2016, Greenpeace Southeast Asia investigated reports of forced labour and deaths onboard two Thai fishing trawlers. A crew of 32 had been hospitalised. Another six died of beriberi- a disease that leads to the inflammation of the nerves and in some cases, heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;

Our office in Malaysia is the fourth office in South-East Asia after Phillipines,Thailand and Indonesia.&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			
				&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;We have officially launched our first office in Kuala Lumpur on Friday, 28&lt;sup&gt;th &lt;/sup&gt; July 2017. Our office in Malaysia is the fourth office in South-East Asia after Phillipines,Thailand and Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/137487_246042.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our executive director Naderev 'Yeb' Saño, said that the Malaysian office is an important milestone in championing serious environmental issues in the region namely climate change, deforestation, energy issues and systemic problems like consumerism and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He quoted that "Southeast Asia is a key battleground for us to win our environmental goals, it is a place where many battles cannot afford to lose,"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the launch, we welcomed more than 60 guests, NGO partners, volunteers and allies to the new space and thanked them for their support. Chief operating officer John Loh quoted that the process of setting up the office took three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/137488_246044.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace has been working in Malaysia on volunteer-led projects focussed on ending haze caused by burning peatlands in the region, and ensuring zero deforestation. In 2014, we launched a report in coalition with local organisations to ‘Stop Lynas’. In September 2016, Greenpeace activists blocked transportation and unloading operations of Malaysian palm oil company IOI Group at the Rotterdam Port, accusing it of forest destruction and child labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is indeed vital for us to work with the Malaysian community in realising the dream of a healthy and prosperous Southeast Asia. We would want to see change and a transformed  world where nature serves to the benefit of the people.&lt;/p&gt;

                    Thick smog blankets Singapore's skyline. The Pollutant Standards Index (PSI), Singapore's main index for air pollution, has hit record levels. These measurements are classified as "hazardous" and can aggravate respiratory ailments. Singapore wants 'strong, firm, effective' action against local companies that may be involved in illegal burning of forests and peat lands in Indonesia, which is contributing to the city-state's worst pollution on record. Greenpeace is calling on the Indonesian government to enforce forest protection and strengthen the forest moratorium. Corporations must also take responsibility for their supply chains, commit to zero deforestation and stop the sort of illegal practices such as fire clearing that are destroying forests and polluting the air.&lt;/p&gt;

                    28 September 2011: On the eighth day of the Greenpeace "Tiger Eyes" tour, Greenpeace activists continued to bear witness to the pathetic sight of Sumatran forests being destroyed by pulp and paper companies. Five Greenpeace activists arrived in the area around the village of Kusuma, District Pangkalan Kuras, Pelalawan regency of Riau Province, to see the condition of the forest which has become one of the Sumatran Tigers last remaining habitats.&lt;/p&gt;

                    Greenpeace today launched its ‘Tiger’s eye Tour’ in Sumatra with a cultural blessing ceremony from local community. The goal of the month-long tour is to highlight the ongoing destruction of Sumatra’s last remaining forests and to mobilise the public to help stop this rampant deforestation. Sumatra’s last remaining forests are the key habitat for the critically endangered Sumatra tiger. &lt;/p&gt;

                    If we don’t watch out, the seafood on our plate might just be tainted by human rights abuses and illegal and destructive fishing. 

Greenpeace investigations uncovered vessels that had been engaged in both human trafficking and the Illegal Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing activity in the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

                    the activists tried to see the condition of important tiger habitat forest, Senepis Forest in Rokan Hilir District, Riau Province. Senepis is a peat forest. In 2007, the Ministry of Forestry designated this area to be a conservation forest for the Sumatran Tiger. Now, however, the forest is owned by three companies, two of them belonging to Sinar Mas’ Pulp and Paper Division (PT. Ruas Utama Jaya and PT Suntara Gaja Pati). And when the activists arrived at Senepsis Forest, they saw only destroyed forests.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether it be persuading high fashion brands to detox their supply chain, creating the largest food art to strengthen the support to ecological farming or exposing a coal mining site in South Kalimantan, we, as always, have been investing our hearts and minds -- and the hearts and minds of our countless supporters -- into building towards a planet which is ecologically sound, healthy and liveable.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/136172_242879.jpg" alt="Activists on the MY Esperanza confront Supply Vessel Explorer II in the Indian Ocean"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greenpeace activists peacefully confront marine operations at the heart of Thai Union’s supply chain in 2016. Activists in inflatable boats delivered a cease and desist letter to the deck of the Explorer II, a supply vessel using an underwater seamount to perch on and contribute to massive depletion of ocean life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, the seafood industry has &lt;a href="https://www.ap.org/explore/seafood-from-slaves/" target="_blank"&gt;profited from forced labour&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/24/world/the-outlaw-ocean.html" target="_blank"&gt;illegal fishing&lt;/a&gt;, ocean destruction and the needless slaughter of marine life. Tuna vessels operate out of sight and get away with just about anything on the high seas. Many times, the companies selling our families tuna have no idea where their fish came from or who caught it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tuna.greenpeace.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Our campaign taking on Thai Union&lt;/a&gt;, the largest canned tuna company in the world, is about so much more than just tuna. It is about changing the entire seafood industry. We know that if we can shift the largest canned tuna company in the world, the rest of the industry will be forced to change as well. The status quo is no longer acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two years of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/press/releases/2016/Esperanza-protest-overfishing-Thai-Union/" target="_blank"&gt;activists and consumers demanding better from the company&lt;/a&gt;, Thai Union is talking to Greenpeace and looking into ways to clean up its operations. The company is considering changes that could significantly reduce the use of destructive fishing methods, help  minimise the risk of labour abuse in its supply chains, address illegal fishing and overfishing, and ensure the traceability of its seafood from ship to plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are monumental changes that will signal to the rest of the industry that it must do better or get left behind. The question is: is Thai Union and its brands ready to lead the industry in a new direction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EaORpPx4QJg" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why, in our latest video, famous internet cats, mermaids, sharks, turtles, and humans alike are pushing Thai Union for action. We need everyone to speak up -- and push for the urgent reforms that are so desperately needed. There’s no longer time for baby steps or half measures. We need the sweeping changes that Thai Union is considering for our oceans and the workers at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thai Union is massive -- owning brands like Chicken of the Sea (US), Mareblu (Italy), John West (North Europe and Middle East), Petit Navire (France) and Sealect (Thailand). The company also supplies retailers, pet food brands, and foodservice companies around the world, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/greenpeace-walmart-canned-tuna_us_5730d52ee4b096e9f092293c" target="_blank"&gt;including retail giant Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. These changes will stretch far and wide, which is why it’s so important we win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t let this opportunity pass us by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1844&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=42721" target="_blank"&gt;Join with Lil Bub, Hannah Mermaid, and activists around the globe in demanding a better seafood industry immediately&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice is daily food for half of the world's population. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/genetic-engineering/hands-off-our-rice"&gt;Genetically modified (GM) rice&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, is a threat to our agriculture, our biodiversity and a possible risk to our health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, GM rice is not grown commercially anywhere in the world. But &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/press/reports/bayer"&gt;Bayer, the German chemical giant, has genetically manipulated rice&lt;/a&gt; to withstand higher doses of a toxic pesticide called glufosinate, which is considered to be so dangerous to humans and the environment that it will soon be banned from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/genetic-engineering/hands-off-our-rice"&gt;Read more about our GM rice campaign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

            “Chief, there is fire at sea!”

He usually awoke early for morning prayers anyway. But that day, Saturday 31 March 2018, he woke up because some of the villagers came to report an extraordinary thing. Oil was creeping into their villages. This was not a good thing for the village at all. Because more than half of the village was built above the water, on the sea of Balikpapan Bay, in East Kalimantan, Indonesia.  The oil grew larger and thicker. It came from a leak in Pertamina’s Refinery Unit V pipe - 25 meters under sea level. Ride moved fast. His first priority was to calm people down and warn them not to light fires. “I called authorities, police, military. Asking for help, together we should calm the community down and prevent them to do any activities involving fire. For instance smoking, also it is customary here people grill fish in the morning,” he recalled. That morning, everyone cooperated and they worked hard to clean up the village. A couple of hours later, they finally had time to take a break and enjoy some breakfast. But before long, Ride was startled by some community members running toward him. “Chief, Chief, there is fire at sea!” Together, they ran to the village area closest to the sea, only 400 meters away from the fire. They saw the fire was raging, smoke was soaring, and, worst of all, it was spreading.  “Chief, should the villagers be evacuated?” one of the people, worried about their safety, asked. “No, not yet,” replied Ride, after assessing the situation. Lucky for them, at that time the tide was turning and the sea was moving away from under their houses. And, thankfully, the fire was put out several hours later. But those who happened to be at sea when the fire started were not so lucky. The area is a busy one, and there were several fishing boats, and even cargo ships, around. Official records released by the government four days later on 3rd April say 5 people died because of the incident.Once the fire was out, it didn’t mean the mean the problem was dealt with. The most obvious and immediate issue was health. “The oil odor was very strong since the first hours,” said Ride. He checked the local health Center (Puskesmas), which was full. Hundreds of people, men and women of all ages, were getting treatment. “The doctor informed me the majority of illnesses were respiratory problems,” said Ride. He predicted at least 1,250 families in the village were exposed to the impacts of the spill. According to Hilda Meutia, researcher and Microbiology expert, the impacts of an oil spill are not always immediate, but also bring the risk of long term and accumulated impacts for human health, as well as the sea and coastal ecosystems.  “Oil spills contribute significantly to the release of toxic and carcinogenic heavy metals and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds. In many cases of oil spills around the globe, sea and coastal ecosystem are also contaminated by several heavy metals such as Cadmium, Plumbium, Vanadium, and Nickel,” Hilda explained. “Yes, there were also visible and immediate impact from direct expose of the spill, such as skin and respiratory disease. However heavy metals are known to bring some risks of long term and accumulating impacts. For instance Plumbium (PB) can cause immunity, reproduction, nerve problems. Kadmium is a carsinogenic material, can cause nausea, headache and stomach problem,” she added.I visited Margasari Village several days after the fire happened. Yes, the oil is less thick and the strong odor has gone. But it doesn’t mean the problems are gone. According to Hilda, “the impact of oil spill can last for years, even can cause permanent damage.” And at the time of this writing, the livelihood of the community is still hampered. The fishermen are still unable to fish. The marine worm farmers are out of the job, and the mangrove forests around the village are destroyed.

                    Sichon, Nakhon Si Thammarat,Thailand,  22 September 2010  – Community
leaders from Sichon meet with the crew on board the Greenpeace
flagship Rainbow Warrior. The Rainbow Warrior arrived in Nakhon Si
Thamarat province today to a colourful reception by a flotilla of
about forty fishing boats and local communities from Sichon who are
opposing Thai government’s plans of setting up a nuclear power plant
in the province.

Greenpeace is calling on the Thai government and the National Energy
Policy Council to get smart and phase out dirty coal and dangerous
nuclear energy from the 2010 Power Development Plan, and instead
invest in sustainable and long term solutions

Thailand’s 2010 Power Development Plan (PDP) has identified 17
potential sites for nuclear power plants in 9 different provinces
including Nakhon Si Thammarat Province in Ban Talet, Ban Thon&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bangkok&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, Thailand, 14 September 2010 --&lt;/strong&gt; The Greenpeace flagship, Rainbow Warrior docks at Klong Toey Port, Bangkok.  On Friday, September 17, Greenpeace is launching the “Turn the Tide – Rainbow Warrior’s Tour of Southeast Asia.”  Greenpeace is calling on the Governments of Southeast Asian nations to support green investments and adopt low-carbon growth pathway for future development.   The Tour also marks 10 years of Greenpeace campaigns in Southeast  Asia to protect forests, catalyse an Energy Revolution,  promote sustainable agriculture and stop water pollution in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current ship is Rainbow Warrior II.  Rainbow Warrior I was bombed in 1985 by French Secret Service agents in New Zealand as it prepared to sail against nuclear testing.  The Rainbow Warrior is one of Greenpeace’s most enduring symbols in their history of campaigning for the environment.  After 52 years at sea (21 years as a Greenpeace ship), Rainbow Warrior II is heading for retirement, but is now visiting Southeast Asia 10 years after its very first journey to the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ship will be open to the public on Saturday and Sunday, September 18 and 19, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

	So what does haze feel like in Singapore? It isn’t like the air pollution those of us in big cities are most familiar with. It doesn’t smell like car exhaust fumes, or the product of chemical industry.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left;" title="Haze Witness" src="/seasia/Global/seasia/2014/haze-witness/5404a52be79e6-haze2.jpg" alt="Haze witness photo from Greenpeace Supporter" width="300" height="200"&gt;Every year the burning of peatlands and forest in Indonesia’s Sumatra and Kalimantan provinces has an effect felt across much of South East Asia. Local farmers and internationally-owned plantations alike employ the slash and burn method to clear vast areas of land, readying it for agricultural use - most commonly for the production palm oil. The smoke of these fires has a transboundary impact, permeating borders and holding other South East Asian communities as a hostage of haze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does haze feel like in Singapore? It isn’t like the air pollution those of us in big cities are most familiar with. It doesn’t smell like car exhaust fumes, or the product of chemical industry. The haze is smoke, generated by the burning of dense organic matter. Sometimes it is hardly noticeable, other times I am painfully aware that I am breathing in thick, heavy particles that aggravate my throat, eyes and lungs. It is not healthy. I don’t like that the air inside feels cleaner than the air outside. I don’t like that I change plans and stay indoors to accommodate painful, ugly and preventable pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the relatively minor health and lifestyle implications that the haze inflicts on me are insignificant when I consider what the conditions must like be for those living in locations where the haze is at its most intense, particularly those closest to the source, who not only suffer terrible health issues but might also find themselves displaced, losing their homes and land. And then there is the devastating loss of forestation, the injurious effect on wildlife, the destabilization of fragile and vital ecosystems, and the huge amounts of carbon being released into the atmosphere to consider. Every time I see the haze closing in on the skyline of Singapore, I am horribly aware that it has originated from a site of environmental degradation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most public health and environmental challenges the solution is not immediately apparent, is complicated and depends largely on political will. But those of us who want to help initiate change must encourage awareness, honest discussion and debate, and push for positive action from South East Asia’s leaders. I don’t want to be just another person complaining about the haze to my friends. I want to add my voice to the campaign to regulate farming practices and ask that corporate owners of large plantations are held to account, particularly in regards to the sustainability of palm oil production. And that is why I have joined Greenpeace’s movement to #stopthehaze and also why I would encourage others to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

	JAKARTA — Greenpeace, together with a broad coalition of NGOs working for biodiversity, human rights, climate protection and representing indigenous people, called on the Indonesian and Norwegian governments to close loopholes in a billion dollar deal to immediately implement a moratorium on all further natural forest clearance both within new and existing concession areas.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the US$1 billion deal are being negotiated after a letter of intent was signed in May this year by Norwegian and Indonesian Governments. As part of the agreement, Indonesia announced a two-year moratorium on any new concessions on conversion of natural forests and peatlands into plantations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is not only what you do, but also what you do not do, for which you are accountable. The Indonesian government must ensure the protection of all peatlands, tropical forests, biodiversity and indigenous people. The devil is in the detail. Details of this deal will set a precedent for future agreements to end deforestation globally, so it must be watertight,” said Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director of Greenpeace International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Irrespective of the moratorium, vast areas of tropical rainforests and carbon-rich peatlands are still earmarked for destruction in Indonesia. To be effective, this deal must revoke all existing permits to clear within these areas,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current Government concessions and illegal logging are devastating Indonesia’s carbon-rich peatlands and rainforests for palm oil and pulp and paper plantations.  The clearing of peatlands and forests significantly contributes to climate change. Indigenous people’s customary lands and rights have been violated, causing social conflict, and natural habitats of endangered species are dwindling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today we provided Indonesian decision makers with what civil society organizations recognize as minimum criteria and indicators for an effective moratorium. Norway’s negotiations with Indonesia to end forest destruction and to protect peatlands could change the course of history and move us forward to solving some of the major crises of our time: tropical rainforest destruction, species extinction and climate change,” said Berry Nahdian Forqan, Executive Director of Walhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumi Naidoo was speaking at a media briefing in Jakarta after the Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior on its ‘Turn the Tide tour of Southeast Asia’ was denied entry by Indonesian government for no plausible grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are saddened by this unfortunate turn of events. Greenpeace is as much Indonesian as it is Canadian, Dutch, Australian, Chinese or any other nation. We are an organisation dedicated only to global environmental protection and peace. We are an organisation that exists only at the wish of the global civil community,” Kumi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deforestation is responsible for about one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions. Ending deforestation must be central to a global strategy to tackle climate change, as it has the greatest potential to quickly deliver massive greenhouse gas emissions cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior’s  two-and-a-half month voyage across Southeast Asia to promote a green and peaceful future began in Thailand on September 17, 2010 and will conclude in Philippines on November 30.  This visit to the region, the ship’s fourth, coincides with the 10th year anniversary of Greenpeace’s official presence in Southeast Asia — as well as the Rainbow Warrior’s first ever tour of the region, the ‘Toxics-Free Asia Tour’ in 2000.  Follow the tour on &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/seasia"&gt;www.greenpeace.org/seasia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace  challenged the United States to dramatically increase the financial support it gives Indonesia to reduce deforestation and cut its substantial greenhouse gas emissions.  The challenge followed the announcement at a press conference in Jakarta with Presidents Obama and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) that the US will provide only limited funds to help protect Indonesia’s rainforests and carbon-rich peatlands.

	Jakarta - Greenpeace today sought an official meeting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seek clarifications regarding the hold-up on the permits to allow the famous environmental campaigning ship, the Rainbow Warrior, to enter Indonesian waters.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The organization’s flagship was supposed to dock in Jakarta’s Tanjung Priok Port last October 13, but was unable to do so due to delays in issuance of necessary permits by the concerned authorities. News reports have quoted Foreign Ministry officials that they will not allow the Rainbow Warrior into the country. But no official denial of entry has yet been issued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow Warrior is currently sailing in the South east Asia region as part of her “Turn the Tide Tour” which brings a message of hope and is a call to action to all ASEAN governments.  Southeast Asia is one of the most vulnerable and least prepared regions to cope with the impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our ship is on a two-and-a-half month mission across Southeast Asia to promote green development. That is our only agenda. All countries aspire for a sustainable future for the sake of future generations. We believe Indonesia is no different. Which is why the delay in the decision is puzzling for us, as of now, we are still waiting for official communication from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs whether they will allow the Rainbow Warrior into Indonesia. “ said Nur Hidayati, Country Representative for Indonesia of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Should the ship be denied entry, it will indeed be a sad chapter in Rainbow Warrior’s 21 year history. The Rainbow Warrior is loved by millions of people around the globe. As a Greenpeace ship, she has challenged the legal system and won, she’s confronted environmental crimes, relocated the population of a South Pacific Island contaminated by radiation, provided disaster relief to victims of the 2004 Tsunami in South East Asia, and sailed against whaling, war, global warming, and other environmental crimes on every ocean of the world,” Nur added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Greenpeace has proceeded with scheduled activities which were supposed to be part of the Ship’s itinerary in Indonesia. Last Thursday, Greenpeace, WALHI and other Indonesian Civil Society Organizations launched the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/news/Indonesia-Civil-Society-calls-for-full-forest-protection-to-save-the-global-climate/"&gt;“Common Platform on Saving Indonesia’s Forests to Protect the Global Climate” &lt;/a&gt;during a REDD (Reducing Emissions from Forest Degradation and Deforestation) workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday, &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/news/u-cant-sink-a-rainbow/"&gt;Greenpeace supporters gathered at Tanjung Priok Port&lt;/a&gt; where they would have held public activities to welcome the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, Greenpeace Southeast Asia will proceed with solidarity activities with coal impacted communities in Cirebon to launch the report ‘The High Price of Cheap Coal: How Indonesians are paying the price for the world’s dirtiest fuel.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We only have one message throughout the tour, ASEAN nations such as Indonesia must Turn the Tide of dirty and destructive development and shift gears toward genuine sustainability.  Stopping deforestation is the quickest and the most effective way to reduce global carbon emissions while ensuring safety and future of thousands of species including millions of people in our country, the region, and the world.  Together with a massive uptake of renewable energy combined with energy efficiency measures, Indonesia can leapfrog ahead of other developing nations in meeting development and energy demands with little or no negative impact on climate and local communities,” said Bustar Maitar, Forest Campaigner of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine a world without forests. It will certainly be a morbid and desolate kind of future. Unfortunately, we are still threatened by this dark possibility. Our survival depends on the state of our forests and we owe it to the animals to ensure their survival, too. “Why?”, you may ask. We have long been taking advantage of nature's resources, even to the point of destroying their natural habitat for the sake of our own personal needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realise that volunteering and adding my voice to a chorus of voices fighting for the  preservation of the forests is quite an uphill battle considering we are up against giants. Through Greenpeace campaigns, I have educated myself on the irresponsible and morally reprehensible acts done by these big palm oil companies that destroy forests for profit. Every time I see a picture of a forest being burned, animals displaced and dying, or locals suffering from the haze, I couldn’t fathom this careless ignorance on the part of these corporations that project themselves to be respectable. I say ‘careless’ because it was their choice to continue ahead with the destruction of our environment. Don’t they realise that the damage they've done will not only affect us, but the rest of the world, too? Just as the melting icebergs in the Arctic pose real dangers to low lying states due to sea level rise, so does the burning of forests in Southeast Asia adversely affects both people's health and the biodiversity that it nurtures.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most frustrating aspect of being involved with these campaigns is the seemingly uncooperative behaviour of the responsible companies. I have always thought that they have a choice of relenting and cutting back on the scale of their production, or choosing not to expand their projects in the first place. What we are hoping for is not for these companies to stop their production, nor are we seeking punishment. What we want is for them to have a meaningful dialogue with us, to have a better understanding and reach a common goal to save and protect our forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to survive in this world, we need to open our minds and work together. It is necessary that we enjoin others, especially the youth, the absolute importance of saving our forests. Many are still daunted by the power held by huge banks like HSBC which funds many palm oil companies. But we too have the power and capacity to take care of our forests. We must never be complacent especially when our own survival and the planet’s future is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	Jakarta, Indonesia – A landmark US$1 billion deal between Indonesia and Norway – intended to halt deforestation and reduce carbon emissions – is in danger of being squandered, unless action is taken to protect it from notorious industrial rainforest destroyers in the palm oil, paper and pulp sectors. Expansion plans show that these sectors intend to utilise the Indonesian government’s ambiguous definitions of forests and degraded land to hijack the funds and use them to subsidise ongoing conversion of natural forests to plantations.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Just a few days before the next round of international climate negotiations begins in Mexico, a new Greenpeace report(1) released today titled “PROTECTION MONEY”, shows how the ‘showcase’ deal – due to be announced in Cancun – could be undermined. Current expansion plans, pushed by industry with support within some Government ministries, seek to treble pulp &amp;amp; paper production by 2025 and double palm oil production by 2020, with additional targets for agriculture and biofuel production. This expansion, coupled with weak definitions for degraded land in Indonesia could see REDD funds, which are designed to support protection of Indonesia’s forests and peatlands, actually being used to support their destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area earmarked for expansion by these sectors includes 40% of Indonesia’s remaining natural forest – an area the size of Norway and Denmark combined (2). Up to 80% of Indonesia’s remaining peatland is also at risk, as well as nearly 50% of remaining forested orangutan habitat in Kalimantan (3). Government figures suggest the forest and peatland carbon at risk amounts to 38GtC – equivalent to four years’ worth of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. (4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has a progressive vision for low-carbon development, and the deal between Indonesia and Norway could set a fantastic example of how the developed and developing world can work together to protect natural forests, and tackle climate change,” said Bustar Maitar of Greenpeace South East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“However, these plans are being systematically undermined by the influence of the palm oil and pulp and paper industry, which is intent on a business-as-usual expansion model that will destroy much of the country’s remaining rainforests and peatlands.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing Indonesia’s data with that of other top emitting countries shows that Indonesia is the world’s 3rd largest emitter of greenhouse gases, chiefly due to deforestation and peatland degradation. (5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, some government figures highlighted in the Greenpeace report show that, with an increased focus on productivity, the targeted increase in production for these industries can actually be achieved without further deforestation.(6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”It’s clear that the palm and paper sectors can achieve expansion targets without damaging another hectare of forest. This would be a win for the industry and Indonesian economy, a win for forest communities and threatened species, and a model of the real-world solutions we need to tackle climate change,” concluded Maitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace, together with a coalition of NGOs working in Indonesia, is calling for an immediate moratorium on the conversion of natural forests to agricultural use and the full protection of peatlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is an independent, global campaigning organisation that acts to change attitudes and behaviour, to protect and conserve the environment, and to promote peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Greenpeace analysis based on 2010 Ministry of Forestry ‘Landuse maps (provincial planning maps/Forest Land Use by Consensus maps (TGHK)’ and 2009 Ministry of Forestry data for Landcover Indonesia 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) Greenpeace analysis based on 2010 Ministry of Forestry ‘Landuse maps (provincial planning maps/Forest Land Use by Consensus maps (TGHK) 2009 Ministry of Forestry data for Landcover Indonesia 2006 and 2004 ‘Borneo Orangutan PHVA Habitats Units' Meijaard et al, the most recent data available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) Greenpeace analysis based on figures from a) DNPI ‘Indonesia’s greenhouse gas abatement cost curve’ August 2010 b) 2010 Ministry of Forestry Landuse maps (provincial planning maps/Forest Land Use by Consensus maps (TGHK)’ c) 2009 Ministry of Forestry Landcover Indonesia 2006 d) 2009 Ministry of Environment ‘Indonesia second national communication under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) – Summary for policy makers’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) Based on comparison of DNPI data (published 2009 and source for their 2010 report) with data from other top emitting countries (China, USA, Brazil, India, Russia) positions Indonesia is the world’s 3rd largest GHG polluter in 2005, the base line year from which the Government has made its abatement plans. See endnote 5 of ‘Protection Money’ report for full explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Pulpwood plantations work on a seven-year rotation. Indonesia’s assumed annual carbon uptake of 8tC/ha/yr (DNPI ‘Indonesia’s greenhouse gas abatement cost curve’ August 2010) implies a delivered productivity of 32m3/ha/yr = 224m3 at harvest. The maximum current national average harvest is 60m3 (Ministry of Forestry December 2009: Bina Produksi Kehutanan Data Release Ditjen BPK sd).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) Palm oil: ‘It is feasible for the government to set 40 million tons of palm oil production without expanding plantations’, Deputy Agriculture Minister quoted September 28th 2010, ‘Step Up Palm Oil Production Without Expansion’ Media Indonesia www.mediaindonesia.com/webtorial/asianagri/eng/?ar_id=NzgyNg==&lt;/p&gt;

	Across the world, countries look to the World Bank more than any other institution for the latest expertise and assistance on development.  This week in Washington, DC the Spring Meetings of the World Bank will bring together thousands of government officials, civil society organizations, journalists and private sector representatives to debate the institutions’ work and implications for international development.  With the United Nations’ climate negotiations set to make a global agreement in Paris this December, it is a critical time for the Bank to put forward ambitious and concrete commitments on how the World Bank will lead the world onto a low-carbon development path.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/112151_184488.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batang residents take action to agains Coal Fired Power Plant in their land.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/speech/2014/12/08/transforming-the-economy-to-achieve-zero-net-emissions"&gt;recent speech&lt;/a&gt; the World Bank President, Jim Yong Kim, stressed “…if we don't confront climate change, there will be no hope of ending poverty…”  He called on countries to agree in Paris to binding language that provides a clear pathway to zero net greenhouse gas emissions before 2100, which is necessary in order to achieve the globally agreed goal of limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank needs to heed its own advice and follow a clear pathway to low-carbon development – starting with its own energy sector operations.  Unfortunately, &lt;strong&gt;the World Bank continues to finance fossil fuel projects and policies that are locking countries into carbon intensive infrastructure that undermine the 2 degree goal. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the World Bank continues to support the development of the 2,000 MW Batang coal power plant in Central Java and two Sumsel coal-fired power plants of 1,200 MW and 600 MW in South Sumatra.  Through &lt;a href="http://priceofoil.org/2013/09/25/world-bank-accelerating-coal-development-indonesia/"&gt;four World Bank infrastructure policy lending operations&lt;/a&gt; worth $850 million, Indonesia established the Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund(IIGF) and the 2012 Land Acquisition Law to support a development model based on public-private partnerships (PPP).  The IIGF provided its first government guarantee of $34 million to the Central Java coal power plant of Batang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the World Bank has a direct $30 million loan to the IIGF which, according to the Bank, involves “a platform for ongoing engagement in the development and appraisal of PPP infrastructure operations” seeking IIGF guarantees.  Part of this on-going Bank engagement involves ensuring IIGF projects abide by an Operations Manual that is based on the Bank’s own Social and Environmental Safeguards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/112153_184484.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/112150_184490.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nearly four years, thousands of Batang residents have struggled against the development of the Batang coal power megaplant to protect their productive agricultural land and rich fishing grounds, which their livelihoods depend on. They have been threatened and attacked by thugs, police, army, and government agents. They and Greenpeace and other groups have protested, filed a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission, and commenced a process to lodge a formal complaint within JBIC. A lawsuit has been filed against the project for environmental violations.  The Ministry of Environment itself is currently reviewing the plant’s EIA. Residents and landowners have complained of facing intimidation and violence to force them to sell their land against their will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the World Bank’s 2013 Annual Meetings, a member of Greenpeace Indonesia traveled to Washington, DC to inform the Bank of the Batang communities’ rejections to the coal plant and local and global &lt;a href="http://priceofoil.org/content/uploads/2013/11/Civil-Society-Letter-to-WB-Pres-Kim-Indonesia-Coal-Oct-2-2013.pdf"&gt;civil society groups sent a letter calling on the World Bank&lt;/a&gt; to request that the government of Indonesia cancel its loan guarantee. But, the Bank dismissed this request and the communities’ concerns stating the Bank was not involved in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continued refusal by villagers to sell their land for the proposed coal plant has forced the Indonesian government to extend the deadline for financial closure of the project for three consecutive years.  &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-indonesia/press/releases/Tak-Penuhi-Tenggat-Waktu-PLTU-Batubara-Batang-Melanggar-Hukum-Jika-Diteruskan/#a0"&gt;Greenpeace Indonesia reports&lt;/a&gt; that, “According to Presidential Regulation No. 66 of 2013: if the companies fail to finish the land acquisition process for Batang in the time allotted, and fail to respect the deadline (October 6, 2014), the agreement between the government and consortium will end and the project must be canceled.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the proposed Batang coal plant has not been canceled. Instead, the project has recently requested that the government-owned power company, PLN, exercise a consignment clause in the World Bank-supported 2012 Land Acquisition Law to acquire the remaining land. The troubles with the Batang plant also did not cause the World Bank to halt the IIGF from approving further government guarantees for two more coal power plants in February this year in South Sumatra – Sumsel 9 and 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to point out that the IIGF has not provided any government guarantees to clean renewable energy infrastructure projects. This is all the more shocking considering Indonesia’s vast and largely untapped potential for geothermal, solar, and other renewable energies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In President Kim’s speech he specifically called on countries to end harmful subsidies to fossil fuels.  Meanwhile, the World Bank continues to create new subsidies to fossil fuels through government guarantees and tax breaks for infrastructure investments, especially in the case of PPP projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank must stop turning a blind eye to the multiple ways it provides support to coal and other fossil fuels. Through policy lending and financial intermediaries like the IIGF, the World Bank is continuing to lock the world into carbon intensive development, which undermines the 2 degree goal and, thus, provides “no hope of ending poverty. &lt;strong&gt;"The World Bank must heed its own advice on confronting climate change, and start by challenging the destructive Batang coal power plant now."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Last week we launched the ‘eye of the tiger’ tour in Indonesia, during which five activists will journey around Sumatra bearing witness to the forest destruction caused by companies like Asia Pulp and Paper (APP).  However, a few days ago we discovered we weren’t the only ones planning a tour around Sumatra. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/community_images//84/2284/28112_55004.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;It turns out that APP had  invited a number of international journalists to visit a flagship APP  ‘conservation project’ so that they could see for themselves how  Greenpeace and other NGOs have got it all wrong about APP’s  environmental record. It’s quite amazing - APP seem convinced that if it  just spends more money on slick PR and greenwashing its image, it will  never have to answer for or change its terrible environmental practices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately  for APP, we were slipped a copy of its tour itinerary; this was an  opportunity we couldn’t pass up. APP and its PR company Cohn and Wolfe  clearly weren’t planning to extend us a formal invite, so our activist  ‘tigers’, dressed in their tiger stripes, checked into the same hotel  that APP was using for its tour. A briefing pack was passed to the  journalists showing them the information APP &lt;em&gt;wouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; be revealing on the official tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 'conservation project' featured on APP's tour is the Giam Siak  Kecil ‘Biosphere Reserve’ - a forest area that sits on top of one of  Sumatra’s peat domes. At its heart lies a core area of protected forest,  surrounded by a larger ‘buffer zone’. This ‘buffer zone’ now largely  consists of swathes of pulpwood plantations, planted after the original  forests surrounding the core of this area were destroyed by companies  like – (yes, you’ve guessed it) - APP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where things  get interesting. When APP and its suppliers got hold of these areas,  they largely consisted of good quality forest. As APP’s own 2007  Environmental and Social Sustainability Report ‘Growing a Sustainable  Future’ indicates (pp141-3), the area hosts endangered mammals, birds,  reptiles as well as plant species. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indonesian law sets limits on where pulpwood plantations may be developed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Land with peatland more than three metres deep should be protected.  Operations on three metre peat that involve clearance or drainage  violate both Ministry of Forestry regulations and a Presidential decree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Various Forestry regulations stipulate that pulpwood and other  industrial timber plantations can only be established on ‘unproductive’  areas (defined until 2004 as areas holding less than a particular amount  of timber per hectare).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Within pulpwood concessions, at least 30% of each concession area is off-limits to plantation development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, guess what: many of  the plantations in this area are largely  or entirely located on peat that is more than three metres deep. At the  time that APP suppliers obtained these areas, most were heavily forested  and contained a significantly greater volume of timber per hectare than  they were legally allowed to clear. Mapping analysis and field  investigations suggest that within several of the concessions far less  than 30% of the area remains covered by forest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s not all. A  number of these concession holders are linked to illegal logging  investigations, corruption cases and tax evasion. (We’ve given further  details on this to the journalists who were supposed to be on the tour  hearing how ‘wonderful’ APP is.) In a number of these very same  concession areas, mapping analysis done by a local coalition of NGOs has  shown that APP has been destroying forests that are clearly and  independently identified as high conservation value.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem  is that you cant ‘see’ any of this simply from taking the flights over  the biosphere reserve that APP is offering to journalists. The core area  of the reserve is still forested and parts of the ‘buffer’ zone are now  made up of mature pulpwood plantations – so it looks green and lush.  You can’t see the deforestation that took place before the plantations  were established. The ‘walk through the forest’ APP is offering takes  place in an area of forest that was protected, rather than the  significantly larger areas that were previously destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/community_images//84/2284/28113_55006.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;Greenpeace's  'Tiger's Eye Tour' was launched to bear witness to the real condition  of Indonesia's forests. Greenpeace is urging the government to review  existing concessionsa and protect peatland and urges industries to  implement a zero deforestation policy in their operations. Image: Ulet  Ifansasti&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APP will of course be taking great care to ensure that the  journalists don’t see any of the areas where large-scale clearance of  natural forests is still taking place around the reserve or elsewhere.  So we’ve pointed some of those areas out on the map that we handed out  to the journalists at APP’s event this evening in Indonesia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s  only once you scratch beneath the surface of APP’s greenwash that its  extensive capacity for deception becomes clear. We’re hoping that the  information we have given to journalists ensures that the real story  behind APP’s role in this flagship ‘conservation project’ will now to  come to light. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;(The source given by APP for this is an undated survey by the Indonesian government’s own CITES Scientific Authority.)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	We all know that break ups are hard. Especially when they involve secrets – like the shameful secret that broke up Barbie and Ken back in June: she had destroyed rainforest in her toy packaging. Her manufacturer, Mattel, was using products from Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), a pulp and paper company notorious for destroying Indonesian rainforests, including the habitat of the endangered Sumatran tiger. Ken was understandably distraught.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/Global/international/artwork/forests/2011/sparkles.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t pretty. But all the drama that followed: Ken’s shocking  interview, a public Twitter feud between the former couple,  inappropriate photos of Barbie with a chainsaw, over 500,000 emails sent  by you to Mattel – all of it has a silver lining. It helped bring the  continuing destruction of Indonesia’s rainforests for pulp and paper out  into the open and forced action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/community_images//84/2284/28373_55576.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="414"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattel recognized it couldn’t allow its supply chains to include  products coming from deforestation and that toy packaging shouldn’t come  at the costs of rainforests and tiger habitat. That was made very clear  by the strong response from people all over the world to the revelation  that Barbie was wrapped up in rainforest destruction. Today Mattel has  brought closure to the couple’s drama by dropping deforestation:  releasing a global policy that will keep rainforest destruction out of  its supply chains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the largest toy company in the world, their  new policy sends a message to other companies that to be a responsible  business you must be vigilant about keeping deforestation out of your  products. As part of its new commitments, Mattel has instructed its  suppliers to avoid wood fiber from controversial sources, including  companies “that are known to be involved in deforestation”. Their policy  also aims to increase the amount of recycled paper used in their  business, as well as to boost the use of wood products certified by the  Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that you know Mattel and  Barbie have committed to dropping deforestation – you probably have only  one thing on your mind. Will Barbie and Ken get back together? We don’t  want to speculate – but couldn’t help but notice that hostilities  between the couple have ceased. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here’s a look back on how the Ken and Barbie breakup drama unfolded online and offline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="http://storify.com/greenpeace/ken-barbie-break-up-over-deforestation.js?template=slideshow"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;[&lt;a href="http://storify.com/greenpeace/ken-barbie-break-up-over-deforestation" target="blank"&gt;View the story "Ken &amp;amp; Barbie break up over deforestation" on Storify]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, the public airing of Barbie’s dirty deforestation  laundry was so traumatic that everyone involved probably needs some time  to heal. Hopefully in time Barbie and Ken will be able to look back and  appreciate that their painful breakup was a necessary trauma. It has  led to Mattel taking action against deforestation, adding to the  pressure from other companies - among them Nestlé, Unilever and  Carrefour,  who are also taking action on these issues. These companies  are committing to removing deforestation from their supply chains and  from their products. And that is worth some tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/community_images//84/2284/28375_55578.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="420"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does Mattel’s commitment mean for the rainforests and the  habitat of the Sumatran tiger? It means that APP is paying a heavy price  for continuing to rely on destroying rainforests for pulp and paper by  losing another high profile customer. People don’t want to buy products  that come from deforestation, and right now companies that want to be  deforestation-free can’t use APP products. Asia Pulp and Paper has to  face these realities and change. APP’s sister company, palm oil supplier  Golden Agri Resources, has already shown that this change is possible  by &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/press/releases/Palm-OIl-giant-announces-plan-to-halt-forest-destruction/"&gt;making strong commitments to stop deforestation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hasn’t happened yet with APP. We saw the tragic costs of how APP operates when we reported on the &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/endangered-sumatran-tiger-dies-in-trap-on-app/blog/35859/"&gt;death of a Sumatran tiger on the border of an APP owned concession&lt;/a&gt;.   In the last two weeks &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/bearing-witness-to-the-threatened-beauty-of-i/blog/37146/"&gt;the Greenpeace tiger eye tour has been documenting continued forest destruction by APP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/tigers-expose-asia-pulp-and-paper-greenwash/blog/37065/"&gt;Our activists have exposed APP’s persistent attempts to greenwash its image&lt;/a&gt; and pass itself off as a company that cares and acts responsibly  towards the environment. As long as APP continues to put its efforts  into marketing campaigns that cover up the truth, rather than changing  its practices – we’ll continue to expose the truth. And we know you’ll  be there with us. Your support is important to keeping attention on the  plight of Indonesia’s rainforests - the habitat of endangered animals  like the Sumatran tiger – thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support our ongoing work to protect Indonesia's rainforests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://greenpeace.org/international/supportus/indonesia-donate" target="_blank"&gt;With  your donation we can continue to investigate, track and document forest  destruction, link it to corporate practices and pressure them to clean  up their act&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is the only organisation doing this work on the scale  that we do it.  We are also one of the only global charities that  accepts no corporate or government funding in order to remain  independent.  But it means we rely on people like you for every cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together we will strike at the very heart of what causes deforestation and stop it in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace volunteers and members of Solar Generation Pilipinas Youth today delivered solar panels to Malacañang Palace as part of a call to President Benigno Aquino III to lead the Philippines on the road to an Energy Revolution. The group is supporting the President’s vision to become the ‘Renewable Energy (RE) Champion of Southeast Asia’[1] and is proposing a roadmap to increase the Philippines’ use of RE to 50% by 2020. This uptake of RE will be coupled with the phase out of unsustainable sources of energy, particularly climate change-causing coal power, to propel the Philippines toward a green development pathway.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As part of the activity, Greenpeace activists decorated Malacañang with pinwheels signed by thousands of Filipinos urging “P.Noy” to lead the global Energy Revolution. They displayed banners calling for an “Energy [R]evolution Now!” and for “50% Renewable Energy by 2020.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We want President Aquino to enjoy firsthand the benefits of renewable energy. Imagine if we had delivered a dirty coal plant here – or much worse, a dangerous nuclear plant – we doubt that he would relish living beside it. Filipinos want what P.Noy wants -- good, clean, dependable energy. P.Noy knows renewables can provide that. The Energy Revolution Roadmap that shows how our country can achieve this and more,” said Amalie Obusan, Greenpeace Southeast Asia Climate &amp;amp; Energy Campaigner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is also a reminder to P.Noy that people are rallying behind him on this. Pinoys want to see a concrete plan of action toward making the dream of a carbon-free development future for the country a reality. The Filipino people could be leading the rest of the world in an Energy Revolution,” she added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Philippines has enacted a landmark Renewable Energy Law last 2008 which has spurred many RE projects throughout the country. But a lot more needs to be done. The RE Law’s vision to steer the country toward a secure and sustainable energy future, while helping mitigate climate change, must be reflected in the Philippine Energy Plan. This entails a corresponding decrease and phase out of fossil fuel use, particularly coal power which is the single greatest contributor to climate change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We are also asking PNoy to come aboard the Greenpeace flagship, the Rainbow Warrior, when she visits Manila this November[2], to sign on to the Energy Revolution roadmap. Time is running out. While world leaders wait on each other to be the first to commit, people in places that are most vulnerable and least prepared to deal with climate change – like the Philippines – are regularly suffering from the impacts. If the Philippines makes the first commitment to specific targets, this will send a very strong message to other heads of states that they should already be committing substantial targets. Our country could be leading Developing Asia and the rest of the world toward a clean development path and a carbon-free future. P.Noy should show the world what true leadership and people power are really like!” Obusan concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #7a8085;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes to editors:&lt;br&gt;[1] President Aquino made the declaration during a briefing with media at the 43rd ASEAN Foundation Day celebrations at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila, Philippines, 8 August 2010.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[2] The Rainbow Warrior, Greenpeace’s flagship, will be visiting the Philippines in November 2010 as part of the “Turning The Tide” Tour of Southeast Asia, docking in Manila Bay on November 27. The visit marks the last SEA-wide tour, as the ship will be retiring next year. The ship is the second incarnation of the Rainbow Warrior and has already been servicing Greenpeace for 27 years, the most famous and serviceable ship of its kind. The original RW was bombed during a sabotage operation by French secret service agents in 1985 and replaced two years later. The new Rainbow Warrior III – the first ship to be constructed specifically for environmental campaigning – is in the works.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Forest Campaigner Zulfahmi, he base in Indonesia write an update about our latest campaign.

  
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a busy few days since the latest phase of our campaign to  stop deforestation in Indonesia got underway.  There are now signs that  both Mattel and Lego are preparing to make changes in the way they buy  their packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattel’s latest statement, released on Friday in the US, suggests  that the company now recognises it has a deforestation problem. However,  it isn’t out of the woods yet and the company must provide more details  and clear timelines to show that they are serious about dealing with  these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/community_images//84/2284/24028_46154.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photo: &lt;a style="font-size: 11px; color: #4b4b4b; outline-style: none; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="http://photo.greenpeace.org/GPI/C.aspx?VP3=ViewBox_VPage&amp;amp;VBID=27MZVNH2VO3P&amp;amp;IT=ZoomImage01_VForm&amp;amp;IID=27MZIFIINWZX&amp;amp;PN=40&amp;amp;CT=Search" target="_blank"&gt;© Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in Denmark, Lego have responded to media enquiries by  stating their intentions to move to fully recycled and Forest  Stewardship Council (FSC) certified packaging sources.  This looks like a  positive step forwards, but again we are waiting for more details and  for information about how they will deal with the issue of Asia Pulp and  Paper (APP), the company doing so much damage to Indonesia's  rainforests.  Disney and Hasbro have, unfortunately, yet to respond to  our campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in Indonesia, APP have not hesitated to respond to our work,  denying there is any problem at all with their operations. In a blog  post, ‘sustainability director’ Aida Greenbury challenged Greenpeace to  ‘explain its timing for an attack on the Indonesian pulp and paper  industry.’   Well, we have of course been very clear that this is not an  attack on Indonesian industry; this is a campaign to stop rainforest  destruction, in which APP plays a major role. But why are we launching  the campaign now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, one of APP’s sister companies in the Sinar Mas  group, Golden Agri Resources (GAR) announced a new forest conservation  policy, stating that they wanted their plantations to have ‘no  deforestation footprint’. The company provided a number of clear  commitments: To protect high conservation areas (through the  implementation of independent assessments); to stop further developments  on peat; to protect areas of high carbon storage;and, on social issues,  to implement the principles of Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC)  when they develop plantations. (Find out more about FPIC &lt;a href="http://www.forestpeoples.org/guiding-principles/free-prior-and-informed-consent-fpic" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, APP also announced a new ‘sustainability  roadmap,’ although there is very little about it that is sustainable.  The roadmap confirms that the company will be reliant on rainforest  clearance to feed its mills until at least 2015, makes no commitments to  stop plantation development on peat, doesn’t include independent high  conservation value assessments, is silent on FPIC and makes no mention  of protecting areas of high carbon storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the four months since these announcements, APP has taken no  further action to stop the clearance of rainforests or peatlands for its  pulp and paper mills. That is why we have launched the campaign now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APP’s responses so far have avoided most of the substantive issues,  but it has tried to re-assure stakeholders that everything is fine  because the company operates legally. APP says it follows the legal  guidelines of the Government of Indonesia and has a responsibility ‘to  adhere strictly with these laws’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the APP press release that said this coincided with a statement from &lt;a href="http://news.mongabay.com/2011/0608-pulp_fraud.html" target="_blank"&gt;the Indonesian President’s Legal Mafia Eradication Taskforce&lt;/a&gt;.  The taskforce called for a re opening of police investigations into  serious illegal logging cases in Sumatra that feature – yes, you’ve  guessed it - a number of Sinar Mas companies connected to APP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, APP glossed over that one when it responded  to our campaign. The company also made no reference to our new  investigation that demonstrates, once more, that its suppliers are  developing plantations on areas of deep peat; something which is illegal  under Indonesian law.

	Jakarta– Greenpeace today expressed serious concern over the Indonesian Navy's harassment of its flagship, the Rainbow Warrior (1). Yesterday, two Indonesian navy vessels ordered the environmental organisation's vessel to leave Indonesian waters as she approached anchorage to take on vital  supplies. The navy ships then continued to escort the Warrior even once she had reached international waters, in breach of international law (2). 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 4px;" src="/seasia/PageFiles/101499/images/Rainbow%20Warrior/rw-indonesia-2010.JPG" alt="" width="226" height="149"&gt;The peaceful campaigning vessel had intended to dock in Jakarta a week ago for its“Turn the Tide” tour of Southeast Asia to promote environmental awareness and solutions, particularly tackling climate change and deforestation (3). However, she was refused entry to Indonesia, even though President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono stated just a few months ago that he welcomed working with non-governmental organisations, including Greenpeace, especially when addressing the problem of deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are extremely concerned by the recent turn of events and believe the Indonesian Government's refusal to allow the Rainbow Warrior into Indonesia runs counter to the country's democratic principles and the right to freedom of expression,” said Nur Hidayati, Greenpeace Indonesia Country Representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time that the Greenpeace flagship has been denied entry to the Republic of Indonesia. In the past, the Rainbow Warrior and other Greenpeace ships have worked in the country with local groups and concerned government agencies in exposing environmental problems including stopping the dumping of hazardous wastes, and helping ensure a successful outcome during the 2007 UN Climate Change Conference in Bali. The Rainbow Warrior also provided disaster relief assistance in the aftermath of the tsunami which devastated Aceh in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace is currently exposing the destruction of the country's rainforests and carbon-rich peatlands caused by the rapid expansion of palm oil and pulp and paper companies, which is driving climate change, pushing species like the endangered orang-utan and Sumatran tiger to the brink of extinction and instigating social conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Yudhoyono is about to finalise an agreement with Norway to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation. If successful, it could create the single largest climate mitigation and adaptation project in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We regret that our campaign to support the achievement of President Yudhoyono’s vision with the help of the Rainbow Warrior appears to be threatened by short-sighted political and corporate interests,” said Bustar Maitar, Greenpeace Indonesia's forest campaign team leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We intend to work even more closely with the President and progressive government ministries and industry in the future, to honour their commitments to protect Indonesia's forests for the sake of the global climate and our future,” concluded Maitar.&lt;/p&gt;

            Celebrating Malaysia Day away from home, for the sake of our forests

				&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/138711_248999.jpg" alt="Malaysia flag"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 16th of September is personally significant to me in many ways. Aside from celebrating Malaysia Day, it also marks my father’s birthday. Every year, on his birthday, we as a family would dine out as a simple way to celebrate. However, this year was an exception. This year, I would be spending Malaysia Day away from my loved ones and far from my homeland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been volunteering with Greenpeace for over a year now. So, when a few days before Merdeka, I was presented with a volunteering opportunity to travel to Ketapang, Indonesia with the Tim Cegah Api (TCA), otherwise known as the Greenpeace Forest Fire Protection Team, to see them them in action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/138463_248428.jpg" alt="FFP team in Ketapang"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is composed of 11 brave individuals, many of whom come from fire impacted communities. They all started out as strangers brought together with a desire to stop forests fires from happening ever again.  I instantly jumped at the opportunity to join them knowing I would be doing something patriotic, as well as help shed light on an issue that hits close to home. I would be going on an environmental mission to tell the story from a Malaysian’s perspective on the haze that’s been haunting Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore for years and years. I was also eager to get to know our Indonesian neighbours and tell their story of hope amidst the destruction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haze coming from Indonesia's forest fires have had an impact on Malaysian society. Who can forget the toxic hazy days of 2015 and 2016? It was so bad, it made the sun disappear and polluted the air, making people sick or scared to go outdoors. Who would want a repeat of that? So, I made a decision to go on this "bearing-witness" trip knowing that I would not only would I miss my father’s birthday, I would also miss my sister’s wedding reception on her husband’s side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never considered myself a patriotic person but of course, I'd stop and stand whenever I’d hear the &lt;em&gt;Negaraku&lt;/em&gt; being played (while saying the words under my breath). I'd put up our Malaysian flag on my car once a year.  But on this special occasion, I felt proud, doing something for my country and for my family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/138712_249001.jpg" alt="Ketapang airport"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 16th of September, I woke up at 3am and took a cab to Soekarno Hatta International Airport Terminal 3- the newly opened terminal. Using the airport wifi, I messaged my dad and wished him a Happy Birthday. I even posted a lengthy post on Facebook for him (something I don’t usually do). It was a long trip. The flight to Pontianak took less than 2 hours, and from there I waited about an hour for my connecting flight to Ketapang, a small town in West Kalimantan where the peat landscape is now under threat due to palm oil expansions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon landing, I observed a few things. I saw a helicopter being loaded for a water bombing activity, to put out fires from above. It made me wonder how many trips the helicopter had to make just to stop forest fires from speading, and I was told that there were only two helicopters servicing the whole of Ketapang. Could you just imagine how busy things were two years ago, at the height of the forest fires?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/138713_249003.jpg" alt="thermometer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I followed the TCA to a ‘mopping up’ activity- to ensure that the fire they put out two days prior was totally extinguished. This is important as fires in peatlands tend to be underground, where you can’t always see them. They brought equipment such as thermometers to measure the temperature of peatlands underground. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/138714_249005.jpg" alt="FFP team walk on burned peatland."&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We drove for a couple of hours to get to the spot, near Sungai Sirih. There, I saw the blackened fields of what used to be plantations and came to realize the destructive power of fire. And that was only a little of what these people in Ketapang had gone through in 2015, when much of the area was engulfed in fires. Visibility was so bad that there were 19 reported deaths and more than 500,000 people suffering from respiratory problems as a direct cause of haze. It made me think about how we were still sort of fortunate in Malaysia, that we only felt the after-effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Malaysians might feel like haze is just a nuisance that would, on occasion, give us a school holiday when the city's air pollution index (API) levels would reach the 200th levels, deemed unhealthy. But for the TCA folks and their communities, the fires were a serious cause for alarm. It was silently seeping into their homes, schools, and offices, robbing people of their right to clean air and a safe and healthy environment. Yet these courageous Indonesians pushed on and refused to be victims of circumstance. This small team of firefighters have taken it upon themselves to stop the forest fires with their own hands. By doing so, they prevent the haze from happening and for that, I salute and thank them. I will be writing about them more in another blog, so stay tuned for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/138715_249007.jpg" alt="FFP team with school kids."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the spirit of Malaysia Day and our Asian culture of lending a helping hand to our neighbours when they’re in trouble, I call upon my fellow Malaysians to support the efforts of courageous groups like Tim Cegah Api. I would also encourage netizens to speak out on social media and remind palm oil companies— especially those that do business in Indonesia— to respect the environment and the people by committing to protect forests and peatlands. These companies should also rehabilitate the lands they've destroyed. It’s the least they could do. People can go further by putting their names on Greenpeace petitions and join the hundreds of thousands worldwide who demand for sustainable palm oil products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/138726_249080.jpg" alt="MY volunteer Sakeenah Binti"&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t regret my decision to leave my family and the homeland for a few days. The trip to Ketapang was an eye-opening experience that has taught me so much. By writing a series of blogs on the forest fires, I’m hoping to raise open more awareness among Malaysians on what is happening in Indonesia and how it affects each and everyone of us on a deeper level. My hope is for all of us citizens of earth to band together and find solutions to the yearly haze problem that threatens our common forests, endangering both people and animals that all call it home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	It’s now been one year since pressure from thousands of people around the world convinced the world’s largest food and drink company - Nestlé - to give Indonesian rainforests and their inhabitants a break by removing products responsible for deforestation from their supply-chains.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width: 250px; float: left; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-right: 5px;"&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/Global/international/artwork/forests/2011/kitkat-thanks-pic%20copy%20copy.jpg" alt="" width="250"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a truly extraordinary and inspiring campaign that saw supporters, activists and concerned consumers - both online and off - maintain relentless pressure for change, the food giant took a giant step forwards by agreeing to a set of unprecedented commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this, Nestlé announced its partnership with The Forest Trust (TFT) to implement a program that would see deforestation removed from all of its products as well as provide the kind of accountability and transparency so often lacking from such commitments. The company is making a serious attempt to raise the bar when it comes to corporate action against deforestation and we will continue encouraging them along this track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such tangible commitments from a company like Nestlé plainly demonstrates not only the importance of the issue, but also the effectiveness of one of our most innovative, sustained and well supported campaigns to date. People power in action is a beautiful thing and everyone involved deserves a big congratulations and a thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2010, after we launched the campaign online, the removal of our &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/campaigns/climate-change/kitkat/"&gt;'Have a break?'&lt;/a&gt; from YouTube sparked a groundswell of interest as well a rapidly escalating PR disaster for Nestlé. Views of the video shot up and helped to drive interest in the campaign –the total number of views on all versions of the video is currently two million!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later and we have seen Nestlé - in collaboration with TFT - adopt new Responsible Sourcing Guidelines (RSGs), supply-chain maps for almost all palm oil and a supplier assessment process that sees Nestlé working with suppliers to identify shortcomings and help them to become a No Deforestation supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it gets better! In an inspiring demonstration of the infectious nature of change, Golden Agri Resources (GAR) - the palm oil arm of the Sinar Mas Group announced earlier this year its adoption of a Forest Conservation Policy, as a direct result of the pressure from Nestlé and other companies like Unilever and Kraft. Working with The Forest Trust, GAR has committed to halt the clearing of areas designated High Carbon Storage (HCS), peatlands and areas of High Conservation Value - including areas vital to local livelihoods and animal habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, there is still a lot of work to be done. Despite such positive and encouraging developments, Indonesia’s rainforest continues to disappear at a terrifying rate. While GAR, one arm of Sinar Mas, makes commitments to conservation, another of its companies - Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) - continues to pulp millions of tonnes of Indonesian rainforest every year; including the habitat of the endangered Sumatran tiger and areas of High Carbon Storage. A map released by the Indonesian government to accompany &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/press/releases/natalia-truchi/"&gt;last week’s announcement of a moratorium&lt;/a&gt;, which puts a temporary halt to forest destruction, makes clear that the Indonesian government will keep allowing APP to destroy significant areas of natural forest and peatland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APP and Sinar Mas need to hear the demands of people all over the world and feel the pressure of the amazing momentum that is building towards forest protection. Until it implements policies that stop the ongoing destruction of Indonesia’s carbon-rich peatlands and rainforests, the Sinar Mas group will continue to sell rainforest destruction in its products and Greenpeace will continue to investigate and expose its malpractices.&lt;/p&gt;

	In a bizarre turn of events usually seen in a John le Carré novel, the executive director of Greenpeace UK has been refused entry into Indonesia. Arriving at Jakarta's international airport earlier today, John Sauven was blocked from entering the country by immigration officials and is being deported, despite obtaining a business visa without any problems. What on earth's going on?
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="/seasia/PageFiles/355716/28745_56383.jpg" alt="" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He travelled to Indonesia to discuss plans with the campaign team in  Jakarta, to visit Sumatra, and to take part in discussions with various  officials and Indonesian companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after John was issued with a visa in London two weeks ago, &lt;a href="http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/greenpeaces-british-chief-still-set-to-visit-despite-visa-rejection-talk/471049" target="_blank"&gt;stories appeared in the Indonesian media&lt;/a&gt; claiming that John had been refused a visa and that he had already been  turned away from Indonesia when he tried to enter the country for a  forestry conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a little odd, given that he hadn't set foot outside the UK  at that time, hadn’t planned to attend the conference, and had already  been given his visa for today’s trip. Clearly there are some influential  forces behind these false claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been given no official explanation why John was refused entry,  but it's the latest in a series of challenges to our Indonesian team, at  the same time that we’ve increased our campaign pressure against the  notorious pulp and paper company &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/tags/app"&gt;Asia Pulp and Paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, there have been a number of attempts to  undermine our work in Indonesia to halt the country's spiralling  deforestation rates. Accusations have made about the &lt;a href="http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/nvironment/fpi-add-voice-to-threats-against-greenpeace/456867" target="_blank"&gt;legal status of our Indonesian office&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/greenpeace-on-defensive-again-over-lottery-funds/458292" target="_blank"&gt;source of its funding&lt;/a&gt;,  none of which hold any water, while small demonstrations have also been  organised outside our office in Jakarta. It has been challenging for  Greenpeace staff and volunteers there to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the nature of the timing, there's a lot to suggest that this is  an orchestrated campaign driven by the various interests that don’t want  to change their destructive business practices. And if those interests  have to go the lengths of barring legitimate entry into Indonesia for  one person and planting false claims in the media, it shows they are  getting very worried about the impact our campaign to stop deforestation  in Indonesia is having.&lt;/p&gt;

            Girl power at its finest: The women of Greenpeace Tim Cegah Api
        </value></breadcrumb><tag><value>forests</value><value>tim cegah api</value></tag><url>http://p3-raw.greenpeace.org/seasia/blog/girl-power-at-finest-the-ladies-of-tim-cegah-/blog/60422/</url><language>en</language><title>Girl power at its finest: The women of Greenpeace Tim Cegah Api</title><date>2017-10-11 17:51:00</date><text>&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			
				&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Greenpeace Tim Cepah Api in West Kalimantan." src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/138850_249384.jpg" alt="Greenpeace Tim Cepah Api"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've recently journeyed to Ketapang, in West Kalimantan, Indonesia &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-seasia/blog/celebrating-malaysia-day-away-from-home-for-t/blog/60362/" target="_blank"&gt;to see the Greenpeace Tim Cegah Api (TCA)&lt;/a&gt;, or the Forest Fire Prevention Team, in action. Why? Because I wanted to see how forest fires happen and how it can be prevented. I also wanted to meet the individuals and groups putting their lives at risk to save Southeast Asia’s fragile forests and the wildlife that inhabit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This special team is composed of 7 males and 4 females- very much your everyday folk but with a strong desire to save the forests they also call home. I stayed with the ladies and got to know all of them during my 8-day trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rocking orange jumpsuits, Ratih, Sola, Jane, and Lara are all fearless females with big big hearts. They volunteered their time, sweat, blood, and tears to be a part of Greenpeace Tim Cegah Api (TCA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their bravery is enviable. For a little over a week, we bonded with a desire to put a stop to the environmental devastation caused by the burning of peatlands and plantations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of them went through an intensive one-week training with the trainers from Greenpeace and local fire fighters. They took on heavy tasks just like the other team members and learned invaluable skills that they can pass on to their respective local groups, to equip communities and protect friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/138851_249386.jpg" alt="FFP Team in a mopping activity in West Kalimantan. "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sola Gratia Sihaloho is a bubbly 20 year-old. Mature beyond her years, she lived through hell that was the 2015 haze. The experience made her want to volunteer and join this year’s Tim Cegah Api. Sola comes from a big family and she has a strong instinct to protect her loved ones, especially her younger siblings from the health hazards of haze. I could relate to her in that way as I have a younger sister. Never underestimate the power of sibling love.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Sola Gratia Sihaloho" src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/138860_249404.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane Yolanda, 19 years old, is someone who feels deeply for those around her. She’s fighting the fires to prevent the same catastrophic conditions of 2015 to happen again. Jane never thought that someone could die from the haze, but it happened to a friend who died in 2015 from upper respiratory tract infection. This led her to join Tim Cegah Api to prevent more people from dying, especially her parents who are highly at risk. Unlike most teens at her age, Jane wants to keep on living in Ketapang despite the worsening conditions, to help her hometown. I can’t say for sure if I would do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Margareta Ratih is a 22 years old university student, studying Information Technology. She's the latest addition to the group, after finding out about Greenpeace and Tim Cegah Api activities from Nilus Kasmi, one of Grenpeace TCA senior members. Like the others, she’s been living in the frontlines and is directly affected by the fire and haze. But Margareta used to put out fires even before she joined Tim Cegah Api, using traditional method which proved to be slow and ineffective to suppress fires and also ignores the importance of fire prevention to protect forests and peatlands. With her new knowledge, she’s properly equipped and now ready to face the fires. One of her biggest challenges is carrying the weight of the equipment, especially the boots. However, she knows very well the importance of the gears especially since they protect the team when they’re out there in the elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larasati Wido Mathovanie, 25 years old, has been a part of Tim Cegah Api longer than the rest of the girls. She loves travelling all over and wishes to see the natural beauty of Indonesia preserved instead of being eroded year by year. Larasati hails from Riau, Sumatera and has come a long way to help the people of Ketapang. In 2015 and 2016, Tim Cegah Api was in Riau, putting out the fires there. Lara sustained injuries and was in a lot of pain but despite that, was determined to continue with the grueling task of fighting fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living with them, sleeping in the same room, they made me feel like I’m family. I could only admire their bravery and the sacrifice they’ve done to ensure a better future for their families and communities. These girls are so inspiring, they make you want to be better and do more for people and the environment. Let's continue to support them and Tim Cegah Api in their brave endeavors. Don’t you think we need more of them in this world? Don’t you want to be just like them?&lt;/p&gt;

	Philippines - Greenpeace Water Patrol activists today highlighted factory discharge pipes along the Marikina River and posted warning signs to call attention to the fact that no policy exists to ensure that chemical effluents from factories are not toxic. The group is demanding the Philippine government to implement a mandatory chemical disclosure system for industries and ensure that there is no more harmful wastewater from factories through a “zero discharge” policy [1].

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;The Water Patrol activists on board rubber boats and wearing protective hazmat (hazardous materials handling) suits, arrived at the Marikina River to inspect discharge pipes that may be dumping toxic chemicals into the river.  Four discharge pipes of industrial sources from two facilities [2] were visited by the team, which also deployed bamboo rafts with signs that say “Ang nasa tubo mo, lason sa tubig ko? (Your pipe, my poison?) We have the right to know!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We have the right to know what chemicals are being poured into the water we use for drinking, fishing or bathing.  There are hundreds of discharge pipes along the Marikina River and hundreds of toxic chemicals likely pass through these pipes daily.  But no one knows exactly what these are.  Greenpeace is reminding government agencies and industries of their responsibility to let the public know about substances that are being discharged into our water bodies,” said Beau Baconguis, Toxics Campaigner of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Oftentimes, our water bodies are being used as final disposal systems for some of the most toxic chemicals, without the knowledge of the majority of Filipinos. Toxic cocktails are directly released into the Marikina River by factories and other industrial facilities, eventually ending up in Laguna Lake, which is now a domestic water and food source for Metro Manila and Southern Tagalog provinces.”

    &lt;p class="description"&gt;Greenpeace Water Patrol activists today highlighted factory discharge pipes along the Marikina River and posted warning signs to call attention to the fact that no policy exists to ensure that chemical effluents from factories are not toxic. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p class="copyright"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END DYNAMIC CONTENT --&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is recommending pollution disclosure systems, such as the Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR), which allow various sectors to participate in environmental monitoring with a common goal of pollution reduction.  It allows manufacturers to be more innovative in their product designs so that the use of toxic chemicals are eliminated and replaced with benign substances in each stage of their productions process [3].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the group, pollution disclosure has existed and is being implemented in other countries such as the United States, members of the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and Chile. The US PRTR has been implemented since the 1980s and has seen dramatic reductions in their pollution load into the environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Aquino government campaigned and won on a platform of transparency, accountability, good governance and public participation. With the continuing decline of water quality and availability, especially in the face of climate change, a pollution disclosure system, consistent with this government’s platform, will allow the different sectors to participate and make effective water protection a reality.  We cannot forever close our eyes to facilities dumping toxic chemicals into our bodies of water. Freshwater is becoming scarcer and scarcer, yet facilities continue to contaminate them with toxic chemicals from their operations. If the public must participate in efforts to reduce pollution discharges into our water, they must be able to freely access pollution data. We need information on pollution and we need them now,” Baconguis added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Preventive measures of water pollution are urgently needed in the Philippines.  The government should:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set up a proper pollutant disclosure system through which the public could easily access a wide range of pollution data;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;immediately establish a list of hazardous chemicals for priority elimination action; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create an action plan with clear timelines to reduce, restrict and ultimately eliminate the discharges of toxic chemicals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color: #83827c;"&gt;Notes to Editors:&lt;br&gt;[1] “Zero discharge” means the cessation of discharges, emissions and losses of all hazardous substances by one generation, supported by interim targets appropriate to ensure progressive and substantial reductions over time. This can be achieved by application of an appropriate combination of waste reduction/prevention techniques including product reformulation, clean production technologies, process modifications, hazardous chemical input substitution and/or on-site, closed-loop recycling. For hazardous substances which are not readily biodegradable and which, therefore, are not amenable to complete destruction through the application of non-polluting waste treatment technologies, their substitution with less hazardous, or preferably non-hazardous, alternatives should be a priority.  Interim targets, are to be set on the basis of validated substance mass balances and waste reduction/prevention plans appropriate for each industrial sector.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[2] Three of the discharge pipes visited that empty into the Marikina River are from Chemrez Technologies, Inc., a company into the manufacturing, processing, and refining of all kinds of chemical products, compounds, derivatives or chemical substances and all kinds of goods, etc. These products include oleochemicals, powder coatings, resins and specialty chemicals, and biodiesel.  The fourth discharge pipe is from Coats Manila Bay, Inc., an international company and leading manufacturer of cotton and polyester sewing threads. Coats is the leader in textile crafts. Its brands include: Anchor, Cannon, Trident, Moon, Coats Astra, and Red Heart.  Coats supplies the sewing thread requirements of the garment industry, including brands such as Levi's, Lee, Jag, Triumph, Bench and Guess, among others. Both companies discharge directly into the Marikina River. Coats is located in Marikina City and Chemrez in Quezon City.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[3] Pollutant disclosure systems such as “Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers  (PRTRs)” is a policy that requires that factories provide information on the types of toxic chemicals being used in their manufacturing process and the quantities of total emissions and effluents released in their vicinity.  Making this information publicly available not only provides monitoring data but also creates pressure for factories to reduce their use and emissions of toxic chemicals and promotes public participation in environmental management. Read more at http://www.greenpeace.org/seasia/th/water-patrol/reports/pollutant-release-and-transfer-register&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example: there are commitments to eliminate discharges of priority toxic chemicals within the European Union and wider North-East Atlantic and Baltic Sea regions. PRTRs are widely used in many regions of the world - the EU, Asia US and Latin America - for reducing and monitoring chemical releases – see http://www.prtr.net/en/links/.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greedy palm oil companies, that only seem to be driven by the bottom line whatever the cost to humanity or biodiversity, have played a major role in this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little or nothing is known about the beauty of the spectacular Birds of Paradise that call the forests of Papua home. So far, around 40 different species of these birds have been found, and they’re considered by some to be among the most beautiful creatures on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/p4-production-content/international/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bdfbdf8a-gp0stsffy_medium_res_with_credit_line-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Street artist Ano paints a mural depicting birds of paradise close to Taipei 101, in the centre of the city. © Greenpeace&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;After ravaging the forests of Borneo and Sumatra, the palm oil industry has reached the final frontier, Papua, home to these Birds of Paradise. Both the birds and the forest could be lost if we allow these companies to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s why street artists and volunteers from all over the world, from Melbourne to Taipei and Vienna to LA, are taking matters into their own hands. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their mission is simple – to re-create the essence of the extravagant, brightly coloured plumage, crazy courtship dances and bizarre behaviours of these birds in our cities through huge artworks on walls. To remind us of the constant threat to Indonesian wildlife, but also inspire us to act to protect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time for us to stand together for the future of Indonesian forests. Artists, students, bird enthusiasts or consumers buying palm oil products in supermarkets, we need to come together and act.&lt;/p&gt;

	The world is quickly reaching a point of no return for preventing the worst impacts of climate change. Continuing on the current course will make it difficult, if not impossible, to prevent the widespread and catastrophic impacts of climate change. The costs will be substantial: billions spent to deal with the destruction of extreme weather events, untold human suffering and the deaths of tens of millions from the impacts by as soon as 2030. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Elektrownia Patnów Coal Fired Power Station" src="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/GP01OE9.jpg" alt="Elektrownia Patnów Coal Fired Power Station" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elektrownia Patnów Coal Fired Power Station.&lt;/strong&gt; The world burns too much coal, oil and gas. That’s why we could soon pass the point for preventing catastrophic climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;a href="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/CO2-emissions.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img title="Largest dirty energy expansions by 2020" src="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/CO2-emissions.jpg" alt="Largest dirty energy expansions by 2020" width="600" height="426"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;click to enlarge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Largest dirty energy expansions by 2020. &lt;/strong&gt;Yet industry is pushing 14 huge coal, oil and gas projects that will soon add 20% to the emissions already causing climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;img title="Wall of Fire - ©Ross Beckley/Image Focus Australia" src="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/flickr-aust-fire.jpg" alt="Wall of Fire - ©Ross Beckley/Image Focus Australia" width="600" height="401"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;©Ross Beckley/Image Focus Australia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wall of Fire. &lt;/strong&gt;People are already suffering from the impacts of climate change. The world has heated up by just under 1 degree Celsius already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Hurricane Sandy Aftermath" src="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/GP04B74.jpg" alt="Hurricane Sandy Aftermath" width="600" height="398"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hurricane Sandy Aftermath. &lt;/strong&gt;Climate change is already supercharging our weather. People are suffering and dying now from climate change. The destruction is enormous. Governments have promised to keep climate change in check. Instead, they are ignoring the warnings of science and allowing these projects, pushing them even. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;img title="Yaroslavl, Russia - ©Liza Udilova" src="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/DSC02914aa.jpg" alt="Yaroslavl, Russia - ©Liza Udilova" width="600" height="398"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;©Liza Udilova&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yaroslavl, Russia. &lt;/strong&gt;Parts of Russia are super cold. Weather events are becoming extreme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;img title="Jerusalem in the snow - ©tlr3automaton" src="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/flickr-jerusalem-snow.jpg" alt="Jerusalem in the snow - ©tlr3automaton" width="600" height="450"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;©tlr3automaton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jerusalem in the snow. &lt;/strong&gt;Jerusalem was blanketed with snow in January 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Open-Cast Coal Mine in Inner Mongolia" src="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/GP047AA.jpg" alt="Open-Cast Coal Mine in Inner Mongolia" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open-Cast Coal Mine in Inner Mongolia. &lt;/strong&gt;Yet China, which already has unprecedented levels of smog, will expand coal production by 20% within a few years. Its CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels will soar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Open Cut Coal Mine in Collinsville, Australia" src="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/GP02FDU.jpg" alt="Open Cut Coal Mine in Collinsville, Australia" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Cut Coal Mine in Collinsville, Australia. &lt;/strong&gt;Despite climate change causing a severe heat wave, Australia wants to double coal exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Hay Point Australia Coal Terminal" src="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/GP04922.jpg" alt="Hay Point Australia Coal Terminal" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hay Point Australia Coal Terminal. &lt;/strong&gt;Its main markets will be China and India where air pollution already kills hundreds of thousands prematurely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Aerial of Great Barrier Reef" src="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/GP01HZG.jpg" alt="Aerial of Great Barrier Reef" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aerial of Great Barrier Reef. &lt;/strong&gt;To export its coal, Australia may destroy the Great Barrier Reef, a World Heritage Area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Powder River Basin Mining, Wyoming" src="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/GP04EGI.jpg" alt="Powder River Basin Mining, Wyoming" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powder River Basin Mining, Wyoming. &lt;/strong&gt;The US, 2nd biggest CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitter, plans a big expansion of coal exports to Asia which will increase emissions and human suffering there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Coal Mine in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia" src="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/GP01YHJ.jpg" alt="Coal Mine in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coal Mine in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. &lt;/strong&gt;Indonesia will allow the destruction of vast areas of wilderness in Kalimantan, on the Island of Borneo, to mine more coal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Shell Kulluk Rig Assessment off Kodiak Island" src="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/GP04F8Q.jpg" alt="Shell Kulluk Rig Assessment off Kodiak Island" width="600" height="387"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shell Kulluk Rig Assessment off Kodiak Island. &lt;/strong&gt;An oil and gas rush may start soon in the fragil Arctic. Big companies, like Shell, want to take advantage of the destruction of sea ice, caused by climate change, to exploit this beautiful area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Polar Bear in the Arctic" src="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/GP049IE.jpg" alt="Polar Bear in the Arctic" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polar Bear in the Arctic. &lt;/strong&gt;The sensitive wildlife of the Arctic are at great risk from oil and gas development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Alberta Tar Sands" src="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/GP01ZO1.jpg" alt="Alberta Tar Sands" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alberta Tar Sands. &lt;/strong&gt;Canada plans to triple dirty oil production from the tar sands, causing a big boost in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Vast areas of wilderness have already been destroyed to get at the oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Estuary in Great Bear Rainforest" src="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/GP01ST4.jpg" alt="Estuary in Great Bear Rainforest" width="600" height="402"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Estuary in Great Bear Rainforest. &lt;/strong&gt;To open new markets, mainly in Asia, a pipeline is planned to run through 1,000+ kilometres of mainly wilderness across the Rocky Mountains and through the spectacular Great Bear Rainforest to the west coast of British Columbia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Spirit Bear in Great Bear Rainforest" src="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/GP01ST9.jpg" alt="Spirit Bear in Great Bear Rainforest" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dolphins in Brazil. &lt;/strong&gt;Brazil plans to allow exploitation of oil just off its coast. Dolphins, whales and other species will suffer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xuanwei Power Station in China. &lt;/strong&gt;The irony is we don’t need to burn coal, oil and gas. We don’t need more to run our economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Dafeng Power Station in China" src="/seasia/Global/international/photos/climate/2013/PNR/GP02EF2.jpg" alt="Dafeng Power Station in China" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dafeng Power Station in China. &lt;/strong&gt;Clean and safe renewable energy, and more efficient use of energy, can run our planet. We can avoid the climate chaos of these 14 major coal, oil and gas projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new Greenpeace report, &lt;em&gt;Point of No Return&lt;/em&gt;, on these projects shows how they will lock in climate chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Report: Point of No Return&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&lt;em&gt; Point of No Return&lt;/em&gt; highlights the hypocrisy of governments. They have promised to keep warming under 2°C. Yet they are promoting projects that will push warming past 3.5° and 4° and likely to 6°. A frightening future.&lt;/p&gt;

	Forest fires are once again raging out of control across Indonesia. In Pekanbaru and other cities across Sumatra, Kalimantan and Papua, millions of people are suffering. A state of emergency has been declared in several regions as the authorities struggle to bring the fires under control. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This is a humanitarian crisis caused by a man-made environmental disaster. These fires are the result of decades of forest destruction and peatland drainage by the plantation sector. It reinforces the need for Indonesia’s pulp and palm oil industries to address the root cause of forest and peatland fires by implementing ‘no deforestation’ policies. Only be ensuring long-term forest and peat protection will the cycle of fire be broken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Last week, President Joko Widodo announced plans to fight the fires by protecting Indonesia’s forests and peatlands, including improving transparency through the One Map initiative. This is exactly the right course of action to take. Over the coming weeks, companies in fire-hit areas should respond to the President’s call to action by stopping routine plantation activities and prioritising fire fighting. With trust so low and the stakes so high, companies must demonstrate to the people of Indonesia that they doing all they can to get the situation under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In addition to deploying all possible resources to fighting fires, both inside your own concessions and in surrounding areas, Greenpeace is asking you to take these steps as part of a Fire Action Plan to help bring the crisis to the earliest possible end: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Require all suppliers to immediately stop forest clearance and any further development on peatland. Actively monitor suppliers to ensure compliance with this policy. Suspend trade with any supplier that continues clearing forest or draining peatlands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Re-flood and implement other water management measures in critical peatland areas to mitigate fire risks, based on advice from independent peat experts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Support the Indonesian government’s One Map initiative by publishing all maps for your own and suppliers’ concessions through Global Forest Watch’s online forest monitoring and alert system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Support an industry-wide ban on forest clearance and peatland development in Indonesia and work with other stakeholders to deliver it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Once the fires have been brought under control we will need to agree industry-wide solutions to ensure that this crisis can not happen again. That must include progress with the One Map initiative and improved forest governance. The industry must also address the economic incentives for forest and peatland destruction through an industry-wide ban on trade with companies that continue to destroy forests and develop on peatland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We must all work together to stop this crisis. I trust that you will play your part.&lt;/p&gt;

                    Dragon Lake (Danau Nagasakti) is an incredibly crystal clear peat lake with a backdrop of primary forest. Once home to the critically endangered Sumatran tiger, the area still supports a great deal of biodiversity. Part of the Kampar peat dome, this area is affected by changes in the water table and forest cover of the entire dome system. The people of Dosan believe the lake is sacred and understand the importance of safeguarding the area – they are the guardians of this forest. Oil palm plantations have expanded rapidly over the past two decades in Indonesia, clearing large swathes of natural forest and critical peatland areas. Promises of economic development and jobs to local communities have not come true for many. An innovative, independent small-holder approach has delivered social and economic benefits and helped protect the remaining forest. The Dosan community has committed to protecting its forests and moving to improved environmental management practices that include zero burning, no herbicide use and improved water management to maintain the peatland water system.05/16/2012&lt;/p&gt;

	Thai Union Group PLC (TU) is the largest producer of canned tuna in the world, supplying to brands and retailers around the globe. But TU has been linked to the darkest sides of the seafood industry: human rights abuses, the wholesale waste of marine life, and the killing of endangered species with destructive fishing methods.  Today’s tuna industry is ridden with environmental destruction, human tragedy and greed. The problems go beyond one company, but TU has the global reach and influence to transform the tuna industry by rejecting the unacceptable practices that dominate the sector. 
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, a series of media exposés have shed light on the brutal treatment of vulnerable men aboard vessels in Thailand's fishing fleets – several of which have named TU in their investigations. These reports highlight that trafficking, forced and bonded labour is part of the business model of companies that have supplied whole fish and raw material to global heavyweights such as TU. A recent Greenpeace investigation, which included interviews with victims of trafficking, forced and bonded labour, highlights how the abusive practices in Thailand's distant water fishing fleets present a severe supply chain risk to TU's tuna operations that goes beyond the piecemeal actions taken by the company in response to media scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One ordinary Monday afternoon on March 11, stuck in Copywriting class for three hours, once again I learned nothing new and got bored. And what do bored students do? They scroll through their phones. I scrolled through mine that day -and changed things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I flicked through some news to find an article about Greta Thunberg by The Guardian. I think we all know by now who Greta is - and those images of her in two short braids and a yellow raincoat, sitting on the concrete floor with her black and white Skolstrejk för klimatet (School Strike for the Climate) sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;img title="Nanticha" src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/144808_263618.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Just as Greta never expected things to happen the way they did after she began sitting in front of the Swedish parliament, I didn’t realize what would follow. Upon reading the article anguish washed over me, and I could not have related to anyone more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I know what it’s like to care so much for such a cause -for some three depressing, stressful and hopeless years, I had gone through that weight all by myself. Sitting alone in my bedroom, most nights I’d be staring at the blinking cursor on my laptop screen, thinking hard, struggling to figure out what I could do for our climate crisis. Some nights I’d come up with something to write about, but other nights I’d curl up in a ball on my bed and let the tears roll down my cheeks, convinced that no one really cares about our dying planet - but also unable to stop caring about it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a writer and environmental activist in Bangkok, I know what it’s like to feel so powerless in such a hopeless place, so alone in such a crowded world. Greta did too, but the 16-year-old has taken advantage of her distress and turned it around. After reading the article, 21-year-old me was inspired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;img title="schoolstrikes" src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/144809_263620.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Creating a Facebook event and encouraging people to skip school and work is easy, I can do it with barely any effort. So I did it. In an hour, “School Strike for Climate Change, Bangkok” was set up for March 15, the same day as 2,000 other strikes in 125 countries. I invited all the 995 people on my Facebook friends list, waited, and hoped for the best. My job was done - or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The next morning, some 100 people clicked ‘Interested’, a few clicked ‘Going’, and few others shared the event. The day after, about 200 people were ‘Interested’. The day after that, it was 300. Messages from strangers started to roll into my inbox asking what we were doing, where we were meeting, and when we were starting. Uh…I replied. I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;People felt they finally had the chance to protect the environment, but they needed a leader, and I accidentally became one. So I made some signs, gave some directions on Facebook, and asked someone for a megaphone. I didn’t know what I was doing, but I did it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;On March 15, about 50 people showed up. Not a lot compared to many other strikes around the world, but a lot more than I had expected. I still didn’t quite know what I was doing, but as soon as I held the megaphone, I just talked - and people listened. People driving their cars, walking on the street, sitting in restaurants, standing on the bridge, waiting for the bus. Hundreds of them stopped and listened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I held another march on Saturday for people who couldn’t make it on Friday. People wanted more, and I just had to give it to them. Once again, I just talked, and people listened. Even politicians did - at least those out campaigning for the election nearby. All I had to do to make them listen was speak up, and loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;img src="/seasia/community_images/0/55000/144810_263622.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;My climate strike was a huge success for me: about 500 people were ‘Interested’ in the event and about 100 in total came to join me. Only two of them were friends I had invited. The rest were strangers, who, perhaps, were concerned citizens just like me. Perhaps they too were having concerns in their own homes and in their own heads, until one day, they stumbled upon my Facebook event and thought: Hey, someone’s doing something.I should too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Many activists start out as lonely people. At first, we ponder in our heads what change we could bring about each day. We mull over what we can’t do, often more than we acknowledge what we can do. We keep that all to ourselves and can’t help but believe we are alone. Truth is, we’re not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-25ad7edc-7fff-f9e4-98ae-178e89f4b9bd"&gt;It just takes one of us, one like Greta, to turn her worries into opportunities. We all can be the one. It will take just one of us to stand up and act. Then, the rest of us will too. No one is alone in this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nanticha Ocharoenchai, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greenpeace activist, a student at Chulalongkorn University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Kuala Lumpur, 29 August 2014 - Greenpeace joined local groups calling on the Malaysian government to deny the granting of a permanent license for the Lynas plant in Kuantan, citing the grave and unresolved radioactive and environmental threats associated with the controversial rare earth processing facility.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The environmental group made the appeal a few days before the government was to decide whether or not to issue a permanent operating license to the Lynas plant, which has faced intense opposition from local groups since the facility started operating a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group’s demands were based on findings contained in its new report entitled ‘A Radioactive Ruse’, which highlights a number of concerns linked to the Australian multinational’s rare earth processing facility, including the company’s insufficient and dubious plans on how it intends to contain and deal with the estimated 6 million tons of waste, with at least 1 million tons likely to be and radioactive waste, that the plant is projected to generate over a production period of 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We appeal to the Malaysian authorities to listen to the demands of local groups and deny the granting of a permanent operating license to Lynas. Our research on the issue reveals that Lynas has not been operating according to best environmental practices and standards.  As far as we know, the company has yet to come up with a convincingly safe and acceptable solution for its radioactive waste outputs, and this is cause for grave public concern,” said Von Hernandez, Greenpeace Southeast Asia Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The amount of the waste generated each year from the Lynas plant could contribute significantly to background radiological exposures of workers and people around the vicinity of the plant and at its permanent disposal site, the location of which the company has so far refused to publicly disclose. Lynas’ possible planned use of a final disposal site for its radioactive waste in Malaysia directly contradicts earlier government demands that no radioactive waste should remain in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; According to Greenpeace findings, neither Lynas nor concerned government authorities provided sufficient information to the public and local communities about the potential pollution and risks involved in the plant’s operations.  The documentation provided by Lynas in order to obtain operating licenses from regulators for example, has not been made accessible to the public. Furthermore, the group accuses the company of applying lower environmental standards for its Kuantan plant, than would be allowable in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “If Lynas were a truly responsible multinational company, it should adopt and observe in Malaysia, the same strict set of environmental standards and safeguards that it would be expected to comply with in its country of origin. The Malaysian government and public were also made to believe that no radioactive waste from the plant would be disposed of in Malaysia. This has now been exposed as a ruse, following reports that Lynas is now planning to “recycle” certain fractions of its radioactive waste stream into construction materials and other commercial product applications. This is a very dangerous proposition with the potential of spreading radioactive exposure rather than containing it, ” added Hernandez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “We hope that the Malaysian government will exercise greater caution and not allow itself to be deceived into believing that Lynas can find safe and beneficial recycling options for its radioactive waste,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Key recommendations from the report include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[CLOSE THE LYNAS PLANT IN KUANTAN] The Lynas Corporation must close the Lynas Advanced Materials Plant (LAMP) processing plant in Kuantan, Malaysia, until it puts in place best practice environmental protection protocols and conditions and comes up with an acceptable solution for the plant's radioactive waste disposal outside of Malaysia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ADVANCE GREEN DEVELOPMENT FOR SOUTHEAST ASIA AND PROTECT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH] In view of the above, the (federal) government of Malaysia must deny Lynas Corporation a permanent operating license, and prioritize the protection of Malaysian environmental and public health interests, modelling green development standards for Southeast Asia in the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[AVOID DOUBLE STANDARDS – STOP EXPORTING POLLUTION TO OTHER COUNTRIES] Government of Australia and Japan and other stakeholders in the operations of the Lynas plant in Malaysia, must uphold the same environmental protection standards, as they demand for their own environment and populations. &lt;/li&gt;

	Greenpeace Southeast Asia 2015 Annual report.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Greenpeace Southeast Asia was founded in 2000 in response to rampant environmental degradation brought about by unfettered development in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="/seasia/PageFiles/742013/ar2015.jpg" alt="" width="278" height="386"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the past decade and a half, we influenced decision-makers in the region by pioneering the call for a massive uptake of renewable energy, stopped forest destruction on the ground where it was happening, bore witness to Southeast Asia’s polluted waterways, legally challenged companies in order to keep our food systems sustainable, and worked with broad alliances to stop illegal fishing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, as we look toward the future, we know our mission remains the same: to safeguard  environmental rights, expose and stop environmental crimes and advance clean development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Greenpeace is running an international campaign to steer the global tuna industry towards more environmentally and socially responsible sourcing.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Tuna stocks globally continue to experience intense pressure from destructive fishing practices and overfishing. Slavery at sea and human rights abuses are rampant in distant water fishing fleets found in every part of the world. It is vital that we protect our oceans, and the tuna fishing and processing sector is an important part of the success of this campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="240" src="https://e.issuu.com/anonymous-embed.html?u=gpsea&amp;amp;d=cannery_report_2018_r17" style="border: none; width: 100%; height: 500px;" width="320"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the third version of Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s Tuna Cannery Ranking. We evaluated nine canned tuna brands in Thailand, seven tuna canneries in Indonesia, and seven tuna canneries in the Philippines. In a span of three years, considerable progress has been made by these tuna processing companies in working towards a more traceable, sustainable, and worker-friendly canned tuna industry. Nonetheless, there is still more work to do across the board to fully meet these goals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Download the full report here: &lt;a title="Tuna Cannery Report 2018" href="/seasia/PageFiles/941169/CANNERY%20REPORT%202018_r17.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;From &lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e366f609-7fff-00b4-1f67-ab5637377082"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sea to Can: 2018 Southeast Asia Canned Tuna Ranking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	"From Sea to Can: 2016 Southeast Asia Canned Tuna Ranking” examines the region’s tuna canneries and the integrity of their supply chains using a 7-point criteria, that sets a score of 70 as the minimum needed for the sustainability and viability of the industry.

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This marks the second consecutive year that Greenpeace Southeast Asia evaluates the performance of canned tuna brands in Thailand and canneries in Indonesia and the Philippines – this time, in one combined report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like last year, Greenpeace Southeast Asia contacted the top 12 tuna brands from Thailand, the top 16 tuna canneries from Indonesia, and the top nine from the Philippines.  Greenpeace requested that the companies participate in this year’s survey process, and offered to help each company to accurately complete the questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, not a single tuna brand or cannery reached the “good” category, which means a score of 70/100 or higher.  Nearly all companies fell somewhere in the “fair” category of 40-69, some barely passing, others in the mediocre middle, and finally, a few falling just short of the “good” category.&lt;/p&gt;

	The palm oil industry is still a leading cause of deforestation in Indonesia. Three years after the world’s biggest palm oil traders adopted ‘no deforestation’ policies, Greenpeace International examined 11 traders to see how much progress they had made. Not only were they unable to prove their suppliers were not destroying rainforests, but most could not say when their supply chain would be deforestation-free.
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;These findings will be met with alarm by household brands that use palm oil. Most brands, including the 400 companies in the Consumer Goods Forum, have committed to clean up their palm oil supply by 2020. Only two of the traders Greenpeace International assessed were planning to meet that deadline. The vast majority had no deadlines at all, leaving their customers with no way to stop dirty palm oil entering their products.&lt;/p&gt;

The impacts include: (1) inadequate land compensation due to improper and non-transparent processes; (2) the destruction of livelihoods, especially to farmers and fishermen, which has impoverished the local community; (3) environmental damage caused by coal waste residue on land and at sea; (4) worsening public health with an increase in respiratory illnesses, and inadequate monitoring of the health impacts of the power plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments at all levels continue to ignore these impacts. The surrounding community is left alone to deal with the problems. Facing these conditions, there are several things that governments must do at various levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buleleng District Government: monitor air quality and conduct periodic medical checks on community surrounding the power plant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bali Provincial Government: monitor of the environmental degradation caused by the power plant and cancel the power plant expansion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Central government: develop a national energy plan based on sustainable, renewable energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
