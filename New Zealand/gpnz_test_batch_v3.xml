&lt;p&gt;It has now been seven days since the container ship Rena struck and stranded itself on the Astrolabe reef, just off the coast of Tauranga and the situation continues to worsen. The vessel is carrying 1700 tonnes of heavy fuel oil, of which it was initially estimated 30 tonnes had been spilled in to the sea. The media now reporting that between 130 - 350 tonnes of oil spilled from the stricken shift overnight.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the slick pours from the stricken vessel, oiled seabirds are starting to wash up on the beaches, with more oiled birds spotted in the water, and local residents are reporting that highly toxic oil globules are washing ashore at Mt Maunganui, one of the country's most popular beaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Government has declared that the spill has the potential to be New Zealand's worst environmental disaster of all time with the salvage potentially taking many months if not years, according to Maritime New Zealand. What's more alarming is that evidence is now emerging that Rena had failed a number of safety checks both in Australia, and more recently in Bluff, with concerns raised over deficient navigational equipment and charts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet it was still cleared to sail in New Zealand coastal waters, only to collide with one of the North Island's most renowned coastal reefs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There have also been questions raised about the use of the highly toxic dispersant Corexit. As I've mentioned in previous blogs, oil spill dispersants do not actually reduce the total amount of oil entering the environment, but instead act as a surfactant which breaks down the physical element of the oil, not the chemical. That means that although the slick may no longer appear on the surface, it increases the long term potential risk to the marine environment in the water column and on the seafloor. Indeed, some experts such as Professor Rick Steiner believe that Corexit should never be used in shallow water, close to shore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the rescue efforts continue, every capability must be focused on further spillage and mitigating against the worst environmental impacts - for the benefit of both the under threat marine wildlife and the local communities. Indeed, Greenpeace have joined many other groups in making both equipment and volunteers available to protect our coastline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This tragic incident is however a stark warning of how fragile our beautiful coastlines are and underlines the need to safeguard them from any future catastrophes. The Prime Minister has rightly been questioned about New Zealand's ability to deal with an oil spill, both in respect to the Rena, but also a much bigger, Gulf of Mexico type event from deepwater drilling. And he's been at pains to state that the two are "unrelated - cannot be correlated". And he's right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The order of magnitude would be far greater if there was a blow out from an exploratory well in the deep waters off New Zealand than from the grounding of a container vessel. But this is only part of the issue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The real issue is the Government's ability to deal with an oil spill, not the source of it. Oil, is oil, is oil and whether it be fuel oil or crude oil, it still presents a threat to the environment, local communities and their economies. The Rena incident is already stretching our capabilities to the limits: how would we cope with millions of barrels of oil spilling in to the Great South Basin or Raukumara Basin? The answer is that we wouldn't, and couldn't. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Acting Energy and Resources Minister, Hekia Parata, earlier this year declared in Parliament that there was "a comprehensive regime in place that involves hundreds, if not thousands, of public servants" for dealing with such an issue. Did she mean for driving through the Government's reckless plans for frontier drilling here in New Zealand, or for responding to an oil spill? If this is so, then the people of Mt Manganui and Papamoa deserve to know where they are right now as the oil washes ashore leaving a toxic legacy on their beaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tragic events unfolding should give the Government pause for thought as they justify their proposals to open up our coastlines to hazardous deep water drilling. When there are much cleaner, safer ways of power our economy and bringing prosperity to New Zealand, they should take every measure possible to ensure that this is the last time we have to be washing oil off of our beaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAKE ACTION: &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/take-action/Take-action-online/No-New-Oil-or-Coal/"&gt;Say no to deep sea oil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Container ship &lt;em&gt;Rena&lt;/em&gt; inexplicably crashed into the Astrolabe Reef, about seven kilometres north of Motiti Island, near Tauranga early on Wednesday. It is carrying 1700 tonnes of heavy fuel oil, some of which has already started to leak into the sea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since then, fears of a potential environment disaster have grown as the leaking oil has spread threatening wildlife, including whales, birds and seals. Indeed, Environment Minister Nick Smith was quoted as saying that the spill from the ship "had the potential to be New Zealand's most significant maritime pollution disaster in decades”. This is very disturbing news.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oiled seabirds have already been found dead close to the Rena and more birds have been spotted in the water, covered in oil. It is also potentially disastrous for the blue whales and dolphins presently calving in the area, as well as numerous other marine species.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Response teams have so far been unable to deploy oil booms to contain the spill. The response so far as been to use a dispersant called Corexit  9500 - which is being sprayed on the water to disperse the oil. Corexit is the same chemical used in the Gulf of Mexico to deal with the oil from BP’s Deepwater Horizon spill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately ‘dispersal’ essentially means never cleaning up the oil. It will just stay out there and continue to pollute the marine environment. The reason being that Corexit acts like a surfactant and attracts the oil. The oil then forms globules and sinks to the bottom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some studies have shown that Corexit 9500 is four times as toxic as the oil itself.  Both are now going into the ocean water. It’s not a good situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the authorities battle to get the spill under control and mitigate against the worst environmental effects, we also hope that this incident gives the Government pause for thought with regards to it’s deepwater oil drilling plans. This accident is an unfortunate reminder of just how difficult it is to deal with oil spills at sea. It's a slow spill in a relatively accessible place, and the weather and sea conditions have been favourable yet even so, it is testing NZ's response capability to the limits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s shaping up to be a significant disaster but, bad as it is, it will be a walk in the park compared to what would happen if we had a Deepwater Horizon type spill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace has offered Maritime NZ the support of our inflatable boats, experienced drivers and volunteers to assist in the oil clean up and the New Zealand Wildlife Health Centre is calling for volunteers to assist in the recovery and rehabilitation of oiled wildlife but as yet there is little anyone can do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the best intentions, the oil spill response team in Tauranga will not be able to do enough. There is no ‘enough’.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tools we have to respond to oil spills are orders of magnitude too small to combat the damage they do. We can’t fix oil spills; we can only prevent them. And we can only prevent the really catastrophic spills by saying no to deep sea oil drilling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The electricity companies conducting a behind-the-scenes fight to keep New Zealand’s last coal-fired power plant at Huntly alive are an “absolute disgrace”, says Greenpeace executive director Russel Norman.


&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Today &lt;a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/business/294834/energy-leaders-discuss-industry-future" target="_blank"&gt;it was revealed&lt;/a&gt; that several of New Zealand’s electricity industry leaders have been meeting with Huntly owner Genesis Energy in an attempt to subvert an earlier decision to close the last two coal fired electricity generating units in 2018.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“These companies claim they’re concerned killing coal could result in a shortage of power during dry periods, but I don’t buy it,” says Norman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Even New Zealand’s Electricity Authority has come forward and said closing Huntly won’t result in a shortage of power, dry year or not. And if there are ever any real issues around supply of electricity, then innovation and forward-thinking when it comes to renewables is something we expect of our electricity providers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s ridiculous that  just one month after nations of the world met together in Paris and agreed to cut emissions, we’re still debating whether or not to use  climate destroying coal fired power here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s absolutely disgraceful that companies like Meridian, which is sold on a clean energy image, are supporting dirty coal. They, along with other electricity companies, have a duty to their customers to look for cleaner solutions.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environment Minister &lt;a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/5763630/Rena-worst-maritime-environmental-disaster"&gt;Nick Smith has declared&lt;/a&gt; that the Rena oil spill off the coast of Tauranga has become the worst maritime environmental disaster in New   Zealand’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of tonnes of oil have now leaked in to the ocean, and with the vessel listing badly in heavy seas causing many shipping containers to fall into the sea. More and more toxic oil globules have landed on beaches as far as Sulphur Point and along the foreshore at Matua. Sheets of thick, pungent oil, two to three metres wide, have been found covering Papamoa beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as the oil from the ship is spreading faster than expected, dead birds and other marine life are being left in its wake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The captain of the ship has been charged under Section 65 of the Maritime Act, covering dangerous activity involving ships or maritime products. More charges may follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the situation is dire and poor weather conditions continue to hamper efforts to tackle the spill and salvage the Rena. There is a very real danger that the ship will break up and disgorge the bulk of the heavy fuel oil remaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/campaigns/climate-change/Rena-oil-spill/Oil-spill-volumes/"&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; margin: 5px;" src="../../../../../../community_images//77/34977/28727_56350.jpg" alt="" width="250"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Given the severity of the situation, and the unavoidable questions being asked of our nation’s capability to deal with an oil spill of this size, it seems extraordinary that John Key has been so adamantly dismissing concerns over the potential risks from opening up our coastlines to deepwater oil drilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a growing concert of concern that this tragedy has laid bare the Government’s ability to cope with such an incident, which has even led to Labour Party leader Phil Goff finally declaring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we can't cope with one ship that grounds offshore only a matter of kilometres from a major port, and it takes us so long to respond to that, what chance would we have of a failed oil well that was pouring hundreds of thousands of tonnes into the sea?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a very pertinent point and we welcome this long awaited insight from the leader of the opposition. It could become a defining issue in the upcoming election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In times of crisis, politicians have an opportunity to become leaders. They have a responsibility to step up and make the tough decisions needed to protect our environment, and safeguard our economy. John Key’s staunch defence of his Government’s oil plans has been littered with falsehoods and obfuscation in an attempt to lead this country to ecological ruin. Enough is enough. It’s time he took action to define his legacy as a forbearer of a cleaner, smarter, more prosperous economy, rather than a clown prince of the fossil fuel circus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time to say no to deepwater oil drilling in New Zealand. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/take-action/Take-action-online/No-New-Oil-or-Coal/"&gt;Sign the petition here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="BlogEnlargeImage" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/community_images//77/34977/17371_33643.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; border: 0; margin: 6px;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/community_images//77/34977/17371_33644.jpg" alt="" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On Saturday five Greenpeace activists &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/campaigns/climate-change/stop-fonterra/action/"&gt;took action on a shipment of palm kernel&lt;/a&gt; entering the Port of New Plymouth bound for Fonterra farms. The five of them were able to stay aboard the ship, locked in the crane cabs and on the anchor chain for 12 hours. Their action brought this important issue back into the public spotlight and highlighted once again the sheer magnitude of Fonterra’s climate crimes and the Government’s complicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ship they boarded was carrying 10,000 tonnes of palm kernel animal feed and that’s only a fraction of the unsustainable palm kernel imported into NZ every year from devastated rainforests and peatlands in Indonesia and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For New Zealand to be bankrolling the palm industry to the tune of &lt;strong&gt;$250,000,000 per year &lt;/strong&gt;is wrong on so many levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coverage of the action drew the same tired old excuses from Government, Fonterra and Federated Farmers. I’ll outline some of the arguments and counter arguments below but the really interesting outcome was that the Government, in its haste to defend Fonterra, now finds itself in a rather embarrassing and contradictory position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Carter was eager to jump to its defence and state that palm kernel was not linked to deforestation. But if he had run that by his colleague Bill English, who has already acknowledged in Parliament to the contrary, he may have chosen his words more wisely. The Minister for Agriculture was also keen to declare that palm kernel was the saviour of farming in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But should New Zealand’s farming success really be tied to an unsustainable trade linked to deforestation, climate change and human rights abuse? Are these really the values that we want Fonterra to represent to the consumers of the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure by Fonterra to take responsibility for their actions and persistent denial of the truth is wearing very thin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing an end to the currently unsustainable and destructive palm trade is a vital step in preserving our planet’s biodiversity and tackling climate change and Fonterra’s actions bring shame on New Zealand. The Government’s failure to act is simply an abdication of their responsibility as stewards of our economy and defenders of our clean, green reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAKE ACTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/take-action/Take-action-online/Send-a-message-to-David-Carter/"&gt;Send a message to Minister David Carter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lies and the excuses:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“PKE is a byproduct or a waste product”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o Only Fonterra and Federated Farmers call palm kernel a waste product. The palm industry itself says that palm kernel is one of the three main products being produced by the industry. Greenpeace, unlike Fonterra, has a full office and team in Indonesia that are experts on the deforestation caused by the palm industry -  Fonterra paying quarter of a billion NZ dollars to unsustainable palm companies increases profitability and therefore furthers rainforest destruction.  Fonterra is lying about PKE in order to protect its profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“PKE only a small percentage of the total feed consumed by NZ’s dairy herds”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o Small percentage of the whole or not, last year NZ imported a record 1.4 million tonnes - second only to the entire European Union countries combined - which was worth over a quarter of a billion dollars. This was a third of the total worldwide production and is bankrolling those companies linked to deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; “If we didn’t buy it, it’d all go to waste”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o This is a truly pathetic excuse. If we didn’t buy it, the palm oil industry would be less viable and easier to stop but even so, we could have used the same argument to continue with New Zealand’s whaling industry. If we don’t do it the Japanese fleet will do it. That just doesn’t stack up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or to paraphrse the Taranaki Daily News editorial - it's like saying that it's OK to kick someone when they're down as long as it wasn't you that knocked them over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Palm kernel doesn’t contribute to rainforest destruction"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o Palm kernel is part of a currently  unsustainable palm industry, to claim otherwise is absurd. We have the images and the video of vast tracts of land being deforested and peatlands destroyed for palm plantations. Fonterra has admitted to using unsustainable palm kernel and the palm industry’s own figures show that only 6% of global palm kernel production is sustainable - the rest comes from deforested land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The cattle would starve and suffer without Palm Kernel”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o In fact, palm kernel is only used because it is so cheap. Grain farmers in NZ who can supply alternative feed have been unable to compete with the cheap alternative and many have gone out of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	The global tuna industry is undergoing a period of rapid transformation. 
&lt;/div&gt;</lead><title>Changing Tuna</title><url>http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/reports/Changing-Tuna/</url><text>&lt;h2&gt;How the global tuna industry is in transition to sustainable supply&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="leader"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	The global tuna industry is undergoing a period of rapid transformation. 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Driven by the urgent need to protect tuna stocks from overfishing or to  help rebuild damaged populations, and in response to growing global  consumer demand for sustainable seafood, progressive tuna companies are  fast adapting their fishing and supply chains to ensure they can meet  new standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Around the globe, some of the biggest  international tuna industry businesses, including leading brands and  major retailers, are making commitments to phase out the use of  destructive Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) when used in purse seine  fisheries, and are actively supporting the designation of the Pacific  Commons as marine reserves by agreeing not to sell tuna sourced from  these locations. Momentum towards sustainability is also starting to  build through the longline tuna supply chain, where urgent and  far-reaching reform is needed to clean up this highly unregulated  sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;This report documents some of the changes  being made by leading brands and retailers around the world to build and  secure sustainable supplies of tuna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the global tuna industry transforms, the question  is not 'who will be the next company to change?' but 'which businesses  will lose out by acting too slowly?'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Oliver Knowles, Greenpeace Oceans Campaigner&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	Many of us watched dumbfounded as the oil-spill disaster in the US Gulf of Mexico unfolded in 2010. Amazingly, as the oil was gushing from BP’s well, Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee was issuing permits for deepwater exploration to be carried out here. Mr Brownlee never questioned Petrobras’ environmental record – which happens to be terrible.

	&lt;p&gt;Responding to today’s &lt;a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;amp;objectid=11605904&amp;amp;ref=NZH_Tw"&gt;MRAG Asia Pacific report into IUU fishing in the Pacific&lt;/a&gt;, Greenpeace campaigner Oliver Knowles said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is daylight robbery, clear and simple. A resource that belongs to the Pacific community is being stripped out by illegal operators, many of them from countries far away from the Pacific.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The issue belies a serious problem – that tuna fisheries in the Pacific are not well controlled or policed. On top of the illegal catches, there is also the huge problem of destructive, wasteful and unsustainable fishing that is legal. The two combined are putting huge pressure on Pacific tuna stocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If we’re serious about protecting tuna fishing in the Pacific governments need to invest more in policing and monitoring fishing to put pressure on the illegal operators.  They also need to take strong action to clean up the legal operators by phasing out wasteful operations like purse seining with Fish Aggregation Devices (FADs) and reigning in destructive and exploitative tuna longlining by banning transhipments at sea.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun rose to lesser amounts of oil on the beaches of Tauranga. Even so, its removal was essential because it’s toxic and harmful to a range of wildlife and human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sunny day enticed hundreds of people out to help (before the rugby). The view as far as you could see from the Papamoa Surf Lifesaving Club looked like hundreds of aliens in space suits removing oil from the sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the day we heard reports of local surfers helping to clean up Matakana  Island. Further south in Maketu local fisherman and surfers took to cleaning up the headland that’s such an important part of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports came in of large numbers of fur seals and shellfish dying on Motiti Island which is closest to Rena the ship that haemorrhaged heavy fuel oil.&lt;/p&gt;

Adam Walters, our scientist at large, dashed across the dunes to capture the little blue penguin and swaddle it in plastic. After finding a box the next stop was the bird hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write, the currents are moving floating oil to an area between Whakatane and East Cape. Authorities have set up community facilities to co-ordinate a clean-up ahead of contact time. But this is a vast coastline with a much smaller population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like nature’s cruel joke to aim the oil into the tribal area of te Whanau a Apanui, the tribe who earlier this year &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/Multimedia/Videos/Flotilla-harbours-in-Tauranga-to-support-Captain-Elvis/"&gt;put themselves on the line&lt;/a&gt; to oppose deep sea oil surveys by Petrobras – directly to prevent disasters like this.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;div class="imageframe alignright"&gt;&lt;a class="BlogEnlargeImage" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/community_images//77/34977/9030_16149.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/community_images//77/34977/9030_14437.jpg" alt="Rainbow Warrior II" width="299" height="453"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Rainbow Warrior II&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Rainbow  Warrior by the French secret service in Auckland’s Marsden Wharf. It  is the day we remember our colleague Fernando Pereira who was killed in  the attack. He was just 35.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article542620.ece" target="_blank"&gt;The  bombing was personally authorised by then French president François  Mitterrand&lt;/a&gt; and was intended to prevent Greenpeace from leading  protests against French nuclear weapons testing on the Moruroa Atoll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/rainbow-warrior-bombing/the-evacuation-of-rongelap"&gt;Just  three months before its sinking, the Warrior helped evacuate 300  residents of the Rongelap Atoll in the Marshall Islands as part of  Operation Exodus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The islanders were escaping from the deadly radioactive contamination  - the legacy of years of US nuclear testing – which had caused  radiation sickness and birth defects in their  children. This was  despite reassurance from the US government that Rongelap was clean and  safe. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/community_images//77/34977/9031_14438.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="345"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;©Greenpeace / Fernando Pereira&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successive US governments’ moral duty to the islanders and the  Marshall Islands has fallen woefully short since the days of its atomic  testing. &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-alvarez/the-legacy-of-us-nuclear_b_586524.html" target="_blank"&gt;The  people’s rights and health were secondary to nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;In 1982, a policy was secretly established by the energy  department during the closing phase of negotiations between the United  States and the nascent Republic of the Marshall Islands over the Compact  of Free Association to eliminate radiation protection standards, so as  to not interfere with the potential resumption of weapons testing. This  resulted in a sudden and alarming increase in radiation doses to the  Rongelap people eating local food.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/08/marshall_islands_longlived_leg.html" target="_blank"&gt;the  radioactive test dump&lt;/a&gt; on Runit which is cracking despite being just  30 years old and designed to protect waste that will be dangerous for  thousands of years. The US Department of Energy has declared ‘the US has  no formal custodial responsibilities for the site’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now the US government is washing it hands of the people of the  Marshall Islands. &lt;a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/nuclear-reaction/2008/12/the_marshall_islands_the_cost.html" target="_blank"&gt;Aid,  funding and compensation are being cut off&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/mar2010/2010-03-03-091.html" target="_blank"&gt;forced  returns to the contaminated islands are being contemplated&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;This year, the 25th year since Rongelap Islanders' voluntarily  evacuated their radioactive island, they are facing a U.S. ultimatum -  move back to Rongelap in 2011 or face cutoff of funding support for the  community at Mejatto Island in Kwajalein Atoll.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The U.S. provided Rongelap Atoll Local Government  with a US$45 million resettlement trust fund to finance cleanup and  rehabilitation work on Rongelap Island’. Just US$45 million. That’s &lt;a href="http://www.globalissues.org/article/75/world-military-spending" target="_blank"&gt;0.2  per cent of the US’s £25 billion nuclear weapons expenditure&lt;/a&gt; and  only &lt;a href="http://milexdata.sipri.org/result.php4" target="_blank"&gt;0.007 per cent of the  country’s total military budget&lt;/a&gt;. Is the US government doing this to  save money or face? Do they hope the people of the Marshall Islands will  be forgotten?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Fernando and the Rainbow Warrior, we must remember the Marshall  Islanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealanders have a rich history of protesting at sea. It is a part of who we are. The boats that set sail to stop French nuclear testing led to a proud legacy that defines us, and our country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry is largely operating outside of modern fisheries management due to resistance from flag states and industry to properly regulate and manage this fishing sector within the five Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs), who are responsible for the world's tuna fisheries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has led to massive overfishing and depletion of the target species bluefin, bigeye, yellowfin and albacore tuna.

				&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;span&gt;After Jacinda’s historic announcement that brought an end to new offshore oil and gas exploration, we’ve been hearing a lot from the industry about how the sky is about to fall in. Fun fact: it isn’t. But just in case  you find yourself having a heated debate with someone around the dinner table, we’ve put together some debate points to help you.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alt Fact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;:  If we stop producing oil here we’ll just have to import more oil from overseas.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Truth&lt;/strong&gt;: New Zealand’s vehicles already run almost entirely on imported oil.  
&lt;span&gt;The fuel we use to fill our cars at the petrol pump is imported from overseas, so won’t be affected by this decision. Virtually all of our relatively small oil production is exported. Sounds weird, but that’s how the global oil market works. According to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/energy/energy-data-modelling/statistics/oil"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand’s locally-produced oil is generally exported because of its high quality and therefore high value on the international market. Australia purchases most of this oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;The Middle East tends to be our largest source of crude oil (over half generally comes from there). Russia and Asia are also significant trade sources.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real alternative to importing oil is more electric trains, buses, cars, trucks, and bikes powered by renewable electricity and biofuels - not more oil drilling. By using more clean, locally-produced energy, we will also reduce our current multi-billion dollar oil deficit, which comes about because we import more oil than we export.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alt Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: Stopping oil and gas exploration will lead to more climate emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Truth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Any oil and gas we keep in the ground is oil and gas that can't be burnt and can't increase global emissions.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, saying that new fossil fuels are out of bounds creates certainty for investors to put their money behind the alternatives - clean technologies like solar, wind, geothermal and battery storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alt Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: When the gas runs out, industry will burn more coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truth&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Clean energy is both technologically available and cost-effective, so we don’t need to replace one fossil fuel with another.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smarter combinations of renewables, demand management, battery storage and electric transport are transforming the way we use energy. It means we don’t actually need outdated, dirty fuels like oil, gas, and coal anymore. Professor Ralph Sims at Massey University has &lt;a href="http://pureadvantage.org/news/2018/03/09/whats-the-point-of-looking-for-more-gas/"&gt;recently shown&lt;/a&gt; that there is no point exploring for more gas, because efficiency improvements and the switch to renewables mean we can cover most of our energy needs without fossil fuels. Using the gas we already have more efficiently also means we’ve got enough left over to power the things that take a bit more time to transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alt Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: Exporting New Zealand gas to developing countries will lower global emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truth&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re far better off investing in clean energy and exporting our expertise in renewables.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;The idea that New Zealand can export gas to developing countries to replace their use of coal really doesn’t have legs.New Zealand isn’t currently set up to process gas into LNG so that it can be exported. Doing that would require a several billion dollar investment in new gas-processing infrastructure, which will take years. Why spend all that money supporting outdated, carbon-intensive technology when we could be using it to deploy modern, carbon-free energy instead?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alt Fact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Oil and gas is one of the backbones of our economy and employs 11,000 people, whose jobs are destroyed by the move to stop new offshore exploration.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Truth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Economies thrive with long term stability. Starting the clean energy transition now means no 80s-style economic shock, and long-term security for the clean energy industry.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Oil and gas employs around 4,300 people directly and it’s really important that these workers and the communities that depend on this industry are supported to find sustainable livelihoods in other industries. The people with the best gauge of whether a decision is good or bad for workers are the trade unions that represent them. Importantly, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.union.org.nz/5441-2/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;NZ Council of Trade Unions has welcomed the Government’s decision&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which provides a long-term signal to the oil industry that they must now wind down and prioritise a transition plan for their workers. They say:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The whole point of a just transition is that actually, we know change is coming, it’s inevitable, and we are going to create high-paying sustainable jobs that match people’s skills. You’d almost think from the reaction from the oil and gas industry that the rug was being pulled out from under working people overnight. The Government and the union movement have been very clear that a transition plan, particularly for affected regions is the right way to go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s not forget that the energy transition is also an enormous economic and job opportunity. Clean energy produces four times more jobs than the oil industry. In the US, solar jobs are growing as much as 12 times faster than the rest of the economy. In New Zealand, clean energy could provide 25,000 new jobs. A recent &lt;a href="https://www.westpac.co.nz/rednews/business/30-billion-benefit-for-faster-climate-change-action/"&gt;Westpac report&lt;/a&gt; found that taking steps to address climate change now will save the New Zealand economy $30 billion dollars, compared to delaying our response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alt Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: The lights will go out and energy will cost more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Truth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;:  Oil and gas cost money - but sunshine and wind are free! Renewable energy is already cheap and has the potential to be much much cheaper.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Solar and wind power have dropped so dramatically in cost that they are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.irena.org/publications/2018/Jan/Renewable-power-generation-costs-in-2017"&gt;&lt;span&gt;already competing with fossil fuels and are poised to undercut new fossil energy in a couple of years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.There are no input costs for wind and solar energy. This means that, while we need to buy the gas for a gas-fired power plant to generate electricity, the inputs for renewable energy - sunlight and wind - are free. As a result, they replace more expensive production in the electricity market, lowering wholesale electricity prices. This is good for consumers but, unsurprisingly, upsets the producers of dirty energy like gas.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;In fact one of the biggest threats to energy security is climate change itself. Extreme weather destroys infrastructure and leads to power outages, such as the recent storms that have knocked out power for thousands of households across the country.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alt Fact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: We shouldn't wind down oil and gas until we have clean energy to replace it.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Truth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;:  Saying no to future gas is vital to getting more clean energy into the system.  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opportunities, technology, and supply of renewable energy already exist for New Zealand to start a direct transition away from all fossil fuels now. &lt;a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/9/9/094008/pdf"&gt;Studies from the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; show that increasing the availability of gas actually has the perverse effect of delaying renewable energy deployment. That’s because, new gas capacity directly competes with renewables. If there’s a chance that the market will be flooded with cheap gas, it makes building renewables a risky investment. Better to create certainty for investors that renewables are the way to go, by making new gas off-limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alt Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: Restricting oil and gas supply is a waste of time - we need to tackle at the demand side.
&lt;strong&gt;Truth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;:  We need to address both supply and demand if we’re going to achieve the necessary cut in carbon emissions. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market forces are driven by scarcity, which means that when there is an abundance of gas available, the price goes down, incentivising industry and the public to use more gas.  When there is less gas available the price goes up, so industry and people use less gas and instead seek out alternatives. Supply does affect demand - and the oil and gas industry know this very well. They’re simply pointing the finger at people like you and me, in order to go on denying their role in reducing harmful climate emissions. As above, the promise of abundant gas supplies discourages investment in other forms of energy, like renewables. But, by signalling an end to new oil and gas exploration, we increase the need for clean energy replacements and stimulate development of those industries. Tackling climate change pollution at both the supply and demand side of energy is vital to success.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Responding to today’s oil block offer announcement by Simon Bridges, Greenpeace’s senior climate campaigner Simon Boxer said:

 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“This looks like a desperate, last-ditch bid by the government to try and save their failing oil plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Last month not one single petroleum company was searching for oil using exploratory drilling. And the government’s last block offer was a massive flop, with not one taker for any deep sea drilling permit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s mad that John Key continues to prop up this sunset industry and ignore widespread local opposition from many, including councils. Climate change is the defining struggle of our generation and it needs to be dealt with now.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than 200 people descended on New Zealand’s largest oil industry conference at dawn this morning and blocked entrances as part of a Greenpeace-organised demonstration of peaceful civil disobedience.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It‘s the first time in New Zealand that Greenpeace has invited the general public to take civil disobedience action en masse. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/live"&gt;The day’s activities are being livestreamed here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The protest comes just days after the announcement that February 2016 was the hottest month in history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

	The month of February has experienced a whopping temperature rise never seen before in the history of record-keeping, according to just-released global satellite data.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Executive Director Russel Norman says temperatures around the planet, including in New Zealand, have experienced such a spike that the world would be “crazy” not to act immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Based on the data that’s just been put out it’s pretty clear that February has obliterated our previous record-setting month. It’s completely unusual, even taking El Niño into consideration. Doing something about this right away is a matter of life and death. We can’t afford to muck around,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even the climate deniers, who ironically have used this very satellite data in the past to further their own agendas, have gone very quiet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action here in New Zealand needs to start with calling it quits on any future oil exploration right away, says Norman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the back of the Paris Climate Conference in January, Prime Minister John Key stated he had no intention of scaling back any search for fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Key is doing less than bugger all when it comes to climate change. And this means we’re facing floods in our homes, and droughts on our farms. We need to make the call now that enough is enough,” says Norman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think this will be the year of peaceful protest in New Zealand. We’ve seen it with the TPPA, and we’re going to see it with the oil industry. Next on the agenda is Greenpeace’s day of peaceful civil disobedience in three weeks at the annual petroleum conference at SkyCity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Greenpeace launched the campaign, pegged as an “an escalation of protest tactics”, and called on members of the public to take part in a co-ordinated demonstration of civil disobedience at the conference in Auckland on March 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone who is concerned about news like February’s overwhelming temperature record should come and join us at the oil conference. We need real climate action,” says Norman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-size:9px;color:2f2f2f;"&gt;Copyright Greenpeace/Malcolm Pullman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In speech and in song their rejection of Government approvals to allow oil exploration in their traditional water off East Cape was clear. It sent goosebumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is not about money, this is about mana, and handing over the signed banners that will be used by the flotilla is a symbol of combining the mana of the Iwi with the people and groups that are supporting us to stop deep sea drilling in our tribal waters,” Rawiri Waititi from te Whānau a Apanui told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, on TV3 Robert Ruha summed it up, “Our seabed is still our supermarket, it is still our Pak-n-Save, and the damaging effects from drilling damages our food store and takes it away our grandchildren”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iwi’s call for support in challenging the Government and Brazilian oil giant, Petrobras’ oil drilling dreams, was heeded by many groups and individuals from all walks of life and was consolidated here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace, Nuclear Free Sea flotilla, Forest and Bird, Coal Action Network, 350 Aotearoa, Coromandel Watchdog and Boardriders Against Drilling have united in the cause too – each with their own particular concerns. Significantly, Ngapuhi and Ngati Porou –the two largest tribes – along with Ngati Kahu and Ngai Tai  pledged support on the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People lined up to sign banners that read ‘STOP DEEP SEA OIL’. A powerful passionate haka lead te Whānau a Apanui forward with the banners which were handed to Daniel Mares the skipper of the &lt;em&gt;Vega&lt;/em&gt; – a small wooden yacht – that relentlessly rode Pacific waves confronting the French Government until they ended nuclear testing in the Pacific. The &lt;em&gt;Vega&lt;/em&gt; is leading the flotilla against deep sea oil drilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flotilla will grow as other boats from around the country from as far afield as Dunedin and the Bay of Islands, head to Cape Runaway next Saturday to meet te Whānau a Apanui on their home turf and work out the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oil spills are a huge risk for the marine environment”, said Clemes Oestreich, skipper of &lt;em&gt;Infinity &lt;/em&gt;sailing as part of the flotilla. “We eat fish from the sea, we love the life in the ocean - the last thing we want is to destroy it. In every way it’s not the way humanity should be going. We have every reason to demonstrate against this behaviour”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the tide of opposition is rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/community_images//77/34977/21460_40663.jpg" alt="" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Contact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed out of Whangaparoa at Cape Runaway under a gloomy sky at sunset on Sunday. The wind was building and as were our nerves as the next phase of the flotilla to stop deep sea drilling began. After such a powerful welcome on Saturday by te Whanau a Apanui we felt that we carried with us the hopes and aspirations not only of the local iwi but also people across the country who are opposed to this kind of reckless pursuit of the last few drops of oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending time with te Whanau a Apanui really brought home how close this issue is to them and the hearts of so many New Zealanders – that so much is at stake here; our beautiful coastlines, essential food sources and the wider marine environment not to mention the havoc that unchecked runaway climate change would deliver to the world if we don’t find a smarter way to meet our energy needs and bring our economy to more sustainable footing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sailing through the night on Infinity we entered the seismic survey zone late Sunday night and began the search for Petrobras’ exploration vessel the Orient Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a brief moment of excitement in the early hours of Monday morning when we thought that we had found it. At 4am we clocked two vessels with a confusing array of lights across the horizon, like strobe lights. Could this be the survey vessel with the seismic testing gear and its support vessel? We kept in contact with the two mystery ships through to dawn but then lost visual contact once the sun rose. Eventually though our deep sea oil vessels turned out to be fishing boats. We bid farewell to our fishing vessels and continued to sail through the survey area on Monday. The hours slipped by and the reality of the challenge we had undertaken began to dawn on us. The area in the Raukumara  Basin where the Government has allowed Petrobras access for prospecting is 12,000 square kilometres. This truly is looking for needle in a haystack. It’s a big ocean out here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optimism of Sunday’s departure from Cape Runaway began to ebb and spirits started to sink. But then came that most beautiful moment when another vessel turned up on our radar. Dead ahead and heading straight for us was the Orient Explorer. We had found her!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hailed the Captain of the Orient Explorer on VHF saying that we represented all New Zealanders who are opposed to deep sea oil drilling, that New Zealanders did not want a Gulf of Mexico type oil spill in our waters and so demanded that they immediately cease their operations and leave the area. After a moment’s pause the Captain of the Orient Explorer replied “ok”. Could it really be that easy? We just ask them to go and they leave? Apparently not as they continued their work as we kept them in range throughout the night.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few dramatic moments when the seismic testing ‘support vessel’ Ocean Pioneer came in extremely close to Infinity and tried to push us off course and steer us away from the survey vessel. However our captain was on the VHF to the Ocean Pioneer and had some stern words leaving them in no doubt that we were observing the rules of the road at sea and that accordingly they needed to give way to us as we were under sail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bearing Witness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday the weather deteriorated and the wind and swell picked up as we sailed into a gale with winds gusting up to 40 knots and a swell of 3-4 metres. As conditions worsened many of the crew began to suffer from the misery of seasickness. There were many green faces and several crew disappeared to their cabins. The ship was rolling relentlessly and sometimes dramatically which brought some spectacular but unintentional power slides across the mess and back again for those still standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was not a lot of sleeping or much in the way of eating as most onboard just focused on keeping the ship running or trying to manage feeling ill. The constant motion is also really exhausting as you have to constantly adjust to the movements. When you do get to your bunk you have to spend most of the night bracing yourself from falling out with the roll of each wave. So the tiredness started to hit home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were also finding it extremely difficult to communicate with the outside world as our satellite phones didn’t seem to be working and when they did we couldn’t hear above the gale force winds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, we tore a great hole in our main sail at dawn due to the conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, spirits again were taking a nose dive. It is at times like these that you can start to question what on earth we are doing out here. Why are we going through this exhausting and uncomfortable experience out here in the middle of the ocean? Are we changing anything by bobbing about miles from anywhere just watching a ship?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of social change tells us, that yes, we are making a difference out here. We are bearing witness – a form of peaceful protest with a strong tradition particularly here in New Zealand. The campaign to stop French nuclear testing in the Pacific is probably the best known example. There are not many New Zealanders for whom the words “Moruroa” and “flotilla” don’t conjure up powerful images and associations of people resisting a greater power in a remote place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By simply being here we are sending a direct and unignorable message to Petrobras and the Government that we do not want deep sea oil exploration in our waters, that smarter and cleaner options are needed to protect our coastline, international brand and to prevent climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not many people can make a journey miles out to sea in this way, so we know that we bring with us the sentiment of many others on land. Bearing witness means going to the place where environmental damage is occurring - be it nuclear testing or deep sea oil exploration – and making the unseen seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we are drawing attention to this issue and John Key, Petrobras and the petroleum industry are being forced to come out and try to defend their positions. They wouldn’t be forced to do this if we were not out here and bringing it to the attention of the public and decision makers on land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/community_images//77/34977/21466_40679.jpg" alt="" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop press: The breaking news from over the weekend was that the Government has had to concede that the wheels are starting to come off its petroleum wagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late on Friday, we received confirmation from the Ministry for Economic Development that two of the key permit blocks that were up for grabs - Northland and Reinga - have failed to sell. In true, cynical fashion they tried to bury this news in some opaque and ambiguous statement on their website &lt;a href="http://www.nzpam.govt.nz/cms/petroleum/blocks-offers/results-of-petroleum-blocks-offers"&gt;(here)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance of this is that these blocks were the centre piece of the Government's sales pitch - the supposed crown jewels of the nation’s oil prospects - and the ones that were going to make us all rich. They covered the 150,000 sq km of ocean that are met by some of the most beautiful stretches of beach I've ever had the pleasure to stretch my legs on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage we cannot say exactly why the blocks were not awarded. The Ministry is trying to release as little detail as possible. But what we can say is that only weeks ago our Energy and Resources Minister was talking up the huge amount of international interest that she said her office had received around the Northland permits, and that an announcement on the successful tender was imminent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospect of deep water drilling in New Zealand has become a very poisonous political issue and it may be that the Government has lost the appetite for another battle this side of the election, in an already politically volatile part of the country. Or it may be that the oil companies are starting to feel the heat of public opposition and have decided that doing business in New Zealand is more hassle than it's worth. We can only speculate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what has been telling is how the investment community has reacted. The Energy New Bulletin is reporting industry insiders as saying “that the Government did not want a repeat of Raukumara, where Greenpeace and Maori protests were held against seismic surveying off the East Cape by Brazilian oil giant Petrobras earlier this year", and that New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Managing Director David Salisbury talked of a recent "significant downgrading of interest" and a "somewhat pessimistic mood" regarding offshore New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of this announcement should not be understated. The economics of doing deepwater drilling here in Aotearoa were always going to be fragile. Without other major oil companies coming to the table, the costs start to become prohibitive and investors get jittery.&lt;br&gt; Indeed, Anadarko has said as much as they look to delay their plans to drill in the deep water off the Taranaki and Canterbury coasts, because there are no other major players with whom they can split the costs of getting the heavy infrastructure down here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also embarrassing for the Government’s heavily criticised energy strategy. It's clear that Gerry Brownlee and his cohorts are desperate to wed our future to the fossil fuels of yesteryear by putting oil and coal extraction at the heart of Government policy, whilst at the same time overlooking our potential as a competitor in the global clean energy race. And the failure to sell off these permits serves only to underline the foolhardy nature of a strategy that's not only risky business for our climate, but also for our future prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/community_images//77/34977/21460_40663.jpg" alt=""&gt;Vanessa Atkinson is a Greenpeace NZ Climate Campaigner. She has been on board the Stop Deep Sea Oil Flotilla every day that it has been at sea off the East Cape.  This is her account of one of her days on board – Friday April 22&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another day out on the water with the Stop Deep Sea Oil Flotilla….. we were greeted at sunrise this morning to the sight of the flotilla congregating once again off the East Cape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predicting where the seismic survey ship the &lt;em&gt;Orient Explorer&lt;/em&gt; is going to be and getting ourselves in the best position to meet her is quite a logistical challenge, particularly as we are in sailing vessels, and so are more limited by wind and weather. That meant that last night we were on a course that was conducive to finding the seismic surveyor, but not for sleeping, as we were thrown around by the seas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further series of calamities beset us as the morning unfolded. For a disturbingly long period of time it looked like our stove was busted and we were not going to be able to have any coffee! After a tense hour the issue was resolved and caffeine flowed once again. But then another disaster! We were out of tea, and so were our fellow flotilla members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just at this moment things started to get really interesting. We had found our target and her new naval escort, the &lt;em&gt;HMNZS Taupo&lt;/em&gt;. They hailed us on VHF and requested that we keep a safe distance and asked for an acknowledgement of their message. We acknowledged their message and asked that they acknowledge that we were here to continue our peaceful protest, which they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the formalities were over they indicated that they wanted to come over and speak to us again. Our fast thinking captain Avon explained that we’d run out of tea that morning and asked if they would mind bringing some over when they popped in for a visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this time when the inflatable filled with police officers with their black helmets and visors on pulled up next to &lt;em&gt;Windborne&lt;/em&gt;, they were packing more than just legal documents, but also some excellent Ceylon blend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then down to the serious business of the day. They had arrived to tell us that the previous legal notice that they had issued to us on April 12 under the Maritime Transport Act was withdrawn. The senior sergeant explained that their concern was about safety and that despite the withdrawal of the notice the police still had powers to act. He even cited the Land Transport Act, though it is difficult to see how this might apply 40 nautical miles offshore, with no land to be seen in any direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still find the sight of a New Zealand naval vessel escorting an oil vessel representing foreign interests a strange and disturbing sight. But neither the presence of the Navy, the Airforce, nor the Police, will deter us. The anniversary of the BP Gulf of Mexico oil disaster was a timely reminder of exactly what we stand to lose here in New Zealand, and we remain committed to expressing our opposition to deep sea oil drilling. Even if we have to do it without tea or coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	2015 is officially the hottest year on record according to NASA, news which the executive director of Greenpeace NZ calls “disturbing” for an island nation like New Zealand.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In the last couple of hours, climate experts from the space agency made the announcement about what they call “record-shattering” global temperatures in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

Since the late-19th Century, the Earth has warmed about one degree Celsius.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace’s Russel Norman says the results are a clear indicator that climate change is happening now and will have drastic consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We need to be backing 100% clean, non-polluting energy and investing in renewable technology,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Instead, John Key is subsidising and encouraging new deep sea oil exploration. Even in the wake of the Paris climate conference, the Government is fawning over foreign oil companies and helping drive the very pollution that is threatening the places we live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Some of the first countries to bear the brunt of this warming will be the Pacific Islands. For New Zealand and our neighbours, NASA has delivered disturbing news.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman says we can expect to see more extreme weather events such as storms, floods and droughts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“As the planet heats up further, melting glaciers and ocean acidification will lead to sea level rise, and coastal communities will be the first to go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The recent report by the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment showed that the increase in sea levels could force tens of thousands of New Zealand families out of their homes and cost tens of billions of dollars.”     &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just yesterday, the Government moved to extend the drought status in the South Island for another six months due to the widespread dry conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a title="NASA" href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-noaa-analyses-reveal-record-shattering-global-warm-temperatures-in-2015" target="_blank"&gt;See the NASA announcement here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	This morning Russel Norman, Greenpeace’s executive director, has demanded that ‘Genesis Energy must close Huntly’s coal-fired generators by 2018.’

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In a letter to the Genesis CEO the Greenpeace boss says that it is ‘frankly shocking that less than three months after Paris, Genesis and other power companies are colluding on strategies to keep coal burning in New Zealand rather than on strategies to cut pollution.’&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;‘You will no doubt be aware that Greenpeace has successfully campaigned for clean energy and against coal power around the world’, Russel points out in the letter, which has been copied to other energy companies including Contact Energy, Meridian Energy, Mighty River Power, TrustPower.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;‘People power will win the battle at Huntly coal’, Russel says, before adding that ‘I hope it need not come to that.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1939&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=47701"&gt;A petition was also launched today here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read the full letter here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To: Genesis Energy CEO Albert Brantley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;CC: Contact Energy, Meridian Energy, Mighty River Power, TrustPower&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Mr Brantley,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Re: The closure of Huntly coal fired power station&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your recent statements that Genesis has been in negotiation with other power companies to keep Huntly’s two coal-fired power plants open past 2018 are deeply disappointing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the Paris Climate Summit (COP21) New Zealand pledged to cut carbon pollution to keep temperature rises below 2C and aspire to a target of less than 1.5C. This places an obligation on Genesis and others in the New Zealand electricity industry to stop burning coal.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is frankly shocking that less than three months after Paris, Genesis and other power companies, most of which are majority publicly owned, are colluding on strategies to keep coal burning in New Zealand rather than on strategies to cut pollution. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year we celebrated your wise decision to close Huntly in 2018. This is exactly what should happen in a world seeking to avoid the catastrophic impacts of climate change. The aging Huntly coal-fired power station should close and strategies implemented to achieve a 100 percent clean energy grid, including a just transition for workers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greenpeace takes a firm stance that, consistent with your original plan, Genesis Energy must close Huntly’s coal-fired generators by 2018.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;You will no doubt be aware that Greenpeace has successfully campaigned for clean energy and against coal power around the world. We are proud that our campaign played a pivotal role in redirecting Mighty River Power away from the Marsden B fossil folly and into geothermal generation. It was a win-win outcome for people, the climate, Greenpeace and Mighty River. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;For us, and for so many New Zealanders like us, clean energy and a stable climate is a defining issue of our age. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your decision to close, or not, the Huntly coal fired power station will be a defining issue of your leadership at Genesis. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;It will either be a decision that you look back on with pride, knowing that you played an important role in giving our kids a stable climate and setting New Zealand on a low carbon pathway. Or it will be a decision that you look back on with shame, as you try to explain to the young people in your life why you had a chance to contribute to a stable climate but instead chose to continue with business as usual towards a climate abyss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The choice is yours. Which side are you on?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;We know which side we are on, and we know which side large, and growing, numbers of New Zealanders are on - they want a stable climate for their kids, not more coal. This is an issue New Zealanders care about, and we will be letting New Zealanders know about this. People power won the battle of Marsden B and, if necessary, people power will win the battle at Huntly coal as well. But I hope it need not come to that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;I look forward to hearing back from you. We would very much like to let our supporters know that you will stay on the responsible side of history on this important decision.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kind Regards,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Russel Norman &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Executive Director ,Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/community_images//77/34977/21466_40679.jpg" alt="" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate Campaigner Vanessa Atkinson is on board one of the Stop Deep Sea Oil flotilla vessels. This is her account of life on board...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday 10 April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the sun crept over the horizon on Sunday morning we were greeted with a beautiful sight – the whole flotilla converging in preparation for our first big day of action. The coming together of the five vessels united by a common goal, white sails glowing pink in the dawn light made for a wonderful moment. Although the synchronized arrival was no act of magic (we had agreed the co-ordinates and time previously) there was still a touch of mystery to see our full flotilla amassing in the first soft light of day, as if drawn together by magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But 35 nautical miles north of East  Cape that day, we had more on our minds than the beauty of a sunrise at sea. Anticipation and nerves were building as we contemplated what was to happen that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had already met with the seismic survey vessel the &lt;em&gt;Orient Explorer&lt;/em&gt; and in the tradition of bearing witness, we have observed and shadowed the ship as much as possible, as a demonstration of our opposition to deep sea oil drilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However today was the day to step it up a notch. Our flotilla shadowed the oil ship for few hours together with our three inflatable boats in the water. Then, loaded with activists and banners, our inflatables headed directly into the path of the &lt;em&gt;Orient Explorer&lt;/em&gt;. In order to conduct its testing the ship must keep a straight course to get accurate data about the formations thousands of metres below. By impacting the course of the ship we are affecting the testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a tense moment while we waited to see how they would react. We hailed the captain on VHF stating that our boats would not move and that he must immediately alter his course and stop operations. The seismic vessel closed on the inflatables but was eventually forced to deviate from its course. And each time it turned our inflatables moved into its path again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several rounds of this we then put swimmers in the water at a safe distance but still on the course and in the way of the ship. Wearing wetsuits and survival suits, each swimmer had a floating buoy and a banner carrying the message ’Stop Deep Sea Oil.’ Our activists in the water stayed staunch and resolute as the &lt;em&gt;Orient Explorer&lt;/em&gt; bore down on them. And once again, success, as the vessel deviated from its course even more dramatically and the cables towing the seismic testing gear behind it sank further into the water. Our activists kept this up for several hours, continually moving in front of the ship and forcing it off course. In the early afternoon, the &lt;em&gt;Orient Explorer&lt;/em&gt; did a full 180 degree turn and headed back along the transect it had been trying to test before we disrupted its operations. Later that afternoon we learned that Petrobras had put out a press release saying that it had ceased testing due to our protest and that it was not sure when it would resume. We had won round one! The news was greeted on the flotilla with big smiles, and a bunch “woo hoo”ing. A few spontaneous dance moves may even have been busted out on deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is just the beginning. If Petrobras or the Government believe that after today the Deep Sea Oil Flotilla will just sail off into the sunset, that we’ve ‘made our point’ and will now head back to the comforts of land and home, they are wrong. The depth of passion out here, and the sense of commitment to doing all that we can to stop deep sea oil exploration, is incredibly strong. The combined forces that comprise the flotilla; the individual captains with their own vessels - including Clemes Oestrich at the helm of &lt;em&gt;Infinity,&lt;/em&gt; and David Armstrong, the skipper of &lt;em&gt;Secret Affair&lt;/em&gt; - together with Te Whanau a Apanui and Greenpeace, remain steadfast and determined. Each will stay as long as they are able and do all that they can to see an end to this reckless pursuit of the last few drops of oil. We are not only buoyed by today’s success but also by the knowledge that we carry with us the sentiment of the thousands of New Zealanders opposed to deep sea oil exploration in our waters. We hope that others will join the flotilla as this campaign rolls out so that we continually build the flotilla’s presence out here off the East Cape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday 11 April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling buoyed by Sunday’s victory we continued to tail the seismic survey ship for as long as we could during the night. It is a strange challenge to try to keep our flotilla together, and our target in sight, out here in the middle of nowhere. It is hard enough during the day, as the different flotilla vessals all have different capabilities. Add a bit of night time and some tiredness and things get really interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we lost visual contact with the &lt;em&gt;Orient Explorer&lt;/em&gt; last night which was very frustrating. But we have a number of different sources of information and we know that we’ll catch up with them very soon. It is a real game of cat and mouse out here and we are determined to keep chasing them and continue our peaceful protest against their activities. We are also confident that they have not been operating for quite a while and that they appear to be running from us, trying to avoid the flotilla. So our success at stopping their operations continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added into this surreal game of hide and seek is the effect of just being at sea and so removed from the goings on on land. After 11 days at sea time has started to take on a different dimension. Things pass more slowly on the ocean it seems. The hours and days slip past and slide into one another becoming indistinct. It is as though we have stepped out of time and are living in an alternate universe. We are so focused on our mission - and just keeping the boats running and the flotilla together - that not much else seems to matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But suffice to say, we are keen to continue our work out here and to bring the message back to the New Zealand Government and Petrobras that deep sea oil is not something that kiwis want in their back yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="BlogEnlargeImage" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/community_images//77/34977/21837_41473.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/community_images//77/34977/21837_41473.jpg" alt="" width="633" height="320"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;From onboard &lt;em&gt;San Pietro&lt;/em&gt;, te Wh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;ā&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;nau &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;ā&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt; Apanui tribal leader Rikirangi Gage radioed  the Captain of the&lt;em&gt; Orient Explorer&lt;/em&gt; and said, “You are not welcome in our waters. Accordingly and as an  expression  of our mana in these waters and our deep concern for the  adverse effects of  deep sea drilling, we will be positioning the te Wh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;ā&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;nau &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;ā&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt; Apanui vessel directly in your path…We will not be moving, we will be  doing  some fishing. That’s what our waters are for, not for pollution…  This is not a  protest. We are defending tribal waters and our rights  from reckless Government  policies and the threat of deep sea drilling,  which our hap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;ū&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt; have  not consented to and continue to oppose…”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stopdeepseaoil.org.nz/audio.html" target="_blank"&gt;You can listen to the audio here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Orient  Explorer&lt;/em&gt; did not stop as police on two inflatables boarded the &lt;em&gt;San Pietro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;Mr Gage said, “Te Wh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;ā&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;nau &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;ā&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt; Apanui oppose Petrobras’ deep sea oil prospecting and drilling for good   reasons. Our ancestors didn’t instruct us to be selfish in the way  that the  Government is thinking, risking so much and thinking of so  few. A longer term  perspective shows that bringing up oil from under  the deep sea floor to be burnt  will cause harm to ourselves, our  resources and the world around us.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;“The Government have abused  their power by  first ignoring us, then apologising to us, now blaming  the people out here with  their heads on the line who want this to stop.  Our mana is not for sale. What  kind of people are we if the gifts we  give to the next generations are beaches  covered with oil and a dead  sea? Or big floods, storms and droughts? The first  thing we must always  do is protect our food resources. Survival comes first.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;“Today a net of a new  generation goes  fishing, one that will catch the lies and one we intend  to stop deep sea oil  prospecting in its tracks.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;“Our ancestors did not agree  to a Treaty  that would ignore the wishes and needs of future  generations and our  environment. They carefully positioned us to  continue to make good decisions  that would enable the future of our  peoples and our cultures.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;San  Pietro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;, is the longliner owned by East Coast iwi, Te  Wh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;ā&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;nau &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt;ā&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-NZ"&gt; Apanui and is part of the flotilla including Greenpeace and the  Nuclear Free Flotilla&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; in its third  week of opposing deep sea oil drilling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The five Greenpeace activists who stormed on board a New Zealand Government climate research ship that was found to be searching for oil have been discharged – and will receive no punishment – after being convicted at the Auckland District Court today.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The five were convicted of being unlawfully on a vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November Siana Fitzjohn, Kailas Wild, Adrian Sanders, Genevieve Toop and Niamh O’Flynn locked themselves on board the NIWA taxpayer-funded climate and ocean research boat, Tangaroa, which had been chartered by petroleum giant Chevron to survey for oil in New Zealand waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two initial arrests, three of the Greenpeace group managed to remain up the gantry of the boat for more than 10 hours, and used social media to connect with people around the country. They also unfurled a sail-shaped banner, reading: “Climb it Change”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tangaroa had been preparing to leave Wellington Harbour, where it had made a pit stop, to continue oil exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its oil and gas capabilities come from a $24 million taxpayer-funded refit it was given in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activist Siana Fitzjohn says she locked herself to the boat to highlight the Government’s “absolutely dishonest” agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Tangaroa should be conducting science in the public’s interest, not serving the agenda of the oil industries that are destroying our climate,” she says. “It is sadly ironic that this vessel is enabling oil companies to threaten our ocean, when ‘Tangaroa’ means ‘God of the Sea’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While John Key assured the world at the Paris Climate Conference that we would take real action on climate change, he continues to push a deep sea oil agenda that endangers our communities. Further exploration for fossil fuels should be seen as an act of violence against humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; April, 2011&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early hours of the morning, still many hours before dawn, we picked up the location of the &lt;em&gt;Orient Explorer&lt;/em&gt; and her support vessel the &lt;em&gt;Ocean Pioneer&lt;/em&gt;. Primed for another exciting day on the water and ready to do whatever we could to help stop the development of deep sea oil, there was again a sense of anticipation and excitement amongst the flotilla. But once the sun rose, things unfolded in a very different way to how we expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked up an unexpected visitor steaming directly towards us at 20 knots – it was the Navy, with their 55m coastal patrol vessel &lt;em&gt;HMNZS&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Pukaki.&lt;/em&gt; When they arrived they patrolled around the flotilla and then headed off ahead towards the &lt;em&gt;Orient Explorer&lt;/em&gt;. Perhaps they were just passing? Apparently not, because an hour or so later they were back on the scene, escorting Petrobras’ seismic survey vessel as they approached our location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had heard rumours from land that the Navy might be called in. Over the last week and a half we have received regular fly-bys from Air Force Orions, perhaps on some kind of surveillance mission. But this was another level entirely. What were the Navy doing out here amongst a peaceful protest in New Zealand waters? We didn’t have to wait long for an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just after 11 an inflatable headed out from the &lt;em&gt;Pukaki&lt;/em&gt; towards &lt;em&gt;Infinity&lt;/em&gt;, packed full of police officers. With sunglasses, helmets and shaded visors down they looked like a swat squad ready to take over our ship. The sergeant asked to speak to the captain (Clemens) and then requested permission to come aboard. Clemens politely declined, saying that they could have the discussion where they were. We were then issued with some legal documents stating that we were not to go within a certain distance of the &lt;em&gt;Orient Explorer&lt;/em&gt;. The police then visited each vessel in the Flotilla to Stop Deep Sea Oil, handing out the same legal notices. They returned to the navy ship which then continued to shadow the seismic survey vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been doing this kind of work as a campaigner and activist for over 14 years and I have never seen the armed forces deployed in such a manner against peaceful protestors. I had held out hope that the New Zealand Government would see sense and not take such a step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it hard to describe the feeling of seeing the military watching as we exercise what is our democratic right, and our obligation - to protest in a peaceful way. It is extraordinary to me and shocking to be surveilled, monitored and shadowed in this way. It is even more disturbing that the interests for which the armed forces have been deployed are those of a foreign oil company. I believe that the Government has not only misjudged the depth and extent of New Zealanders’ opposition to deep sea oil development, but that it has become so blinded by a misguided pursuit of any economic development at any cost that it has failed to understand the implications of engaging military resources against its own people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has done nothing but further strengthen the resolve amongst the flotilla to continue the campaign, and to stay here for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	Greenpeace is calling for members of the public to take part in a co-ordinated demonstration of peaceful civil disobedience at the annual petroleum conference at SkyCity in Auckland.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This morning the organisation launched the campaign, described as an “escalation in protest tactics”, which will culminate at the conference on March 21.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Climate campaigner Steve Abel says despite years of public opposition and a failure to find any deep sea oil, John Key’s Government has continued to invest in deep sea drilling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Everyone who is concerned about this should come and join us for civil disobedience at the oil conference. Every year for the past three years, thousands of New Zealanders have marched up to the petroleum summit to show they are not ok with this Government’s oil agenda,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s reached the point where we need an escalation. We can’t sit by while climate-change drives extreme flooding, storms and droughts that threaten our communities and livelihoods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If we are to have a future, the oil industry can have no future. It’s plain mad that John Key continues to prop it up. Climate change is the defining struggle of our generation and it needs to be dealt with now.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abel says public participation is one of the most effective tools for creating change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We should take inspiration from people like Gandhi, Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr, and the movements here in New Zealand that opposed apartheid and made us nuclear free,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In the face of Government inaction it’s going to take people power to secure the future we urgently need - one that’s run on 100% clean energy.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yesterday, Greenpeace hinted at the peaceful civil disobedience event when a short video appeared on its social media pages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The clip features people wearing black-tie attire at SkyCity, holding a large card that reads, “What’s on the cards here at the oil conference on March 21?” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abel says Greenpeace isn’t publicly releasing specific details of what the peaceful demonstration at the petroleum summit will look like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We want some things to be revealed to Key and his oil industry chums on the day, but we will be giving ongoing information to all those who are interested in being part of this.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;In the film Amazing Grace  set in the 19th century there is a scene where the British Parliament is debating the end of slavery.  Members of that Parliament argue that the end of slavery would have massive economic impacts that would harm Britain and therefore, as unpleasant as it is, slavery must continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arguments against policy action on climate change here and now in the 21st century run a very similar line.  With hindsight the pro-slavery parliamentarians of 19th century Europe – whilst they held the majority for a time – were in fact a dying breed doomed to be overtaken by the unstoppable progress of culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral case for action on climate change is similarly strong as that for action to end slavery.  Both are undeniable causes of significant human suffering.  There are those urging change and those upholding the status quo – how quickly the former succeed will directly determine the quality of life for present and future generations. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral case for action on climate change is solid, but the economic case against the fossil fuel industry is perhaps more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="BlogEnlargeImage" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/community_images//77/34977/9007_16131.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/community_images//77/34977/9007_14414.jpg" alt="Deep Water Horizon Oil Slick" width="300" height="193"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the world’s richest economy fails to stem the catastrophic flow of a blown offshore oil well there was not a hint of irony in our Development Minister Gerry Brownlee’s voice when he announced yesterday the “great pleasure” he felt at signing an offshore drilling deal with Brazilian oil-giant Petrobras – you could almost see the dollars glinting in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On National Radio (1) this morning he stated that, “One thing is for absolute sure: the hydrocarbon economy of the world is not going to disappear in the next 10-20 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His certainty in the hydrocarbon economy struck me on two levels – firstly that he is anxious to state it and secondly that his desire to participate, perpetuate and invite the hydrocarbon economy to deepen its relationship with New Zealand is clearly not for any moral reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the era of climate change the hydrocarbon economy is exactly what needs to “disappear” if we are to stem the tide of climate change.  But Brownlee has no interest in New Zealand being on the frontier of the clean-tech and renewable energy revolution that will eclipse hydrocarbons as the worlds primary energy source in coming decades.  Rather he is batting for the old ways – he sees the unexplored frontier much the same as his settler ancestors saw it 150 years ago.  He dreams of precious minerals in the hills and proposes we mine them; he thinks of basins of oil under the sea and wants to exploit the resource to make New Zealand rich.  It has all the character of 19th century oil and gold fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="imageframe alignleft"&gt;&lt;a class="BlogEnlargeImage" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/community_images//77/34977/9008_16132.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/community_images//77/34977/9008_14415.jpg" alt="Petrobras P-36" width="300" height="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Brownlee’s economic case for hydrocarbons is also a mirage.  Describing deep sea oil drilling as a “long-term development strategy,” (2) shows the shallowness of his analysis.  Oil is a finite resource so by definition is a short term economy, all the more so in a world desperately seeking clean alternatives to fossil fuel dependency.  Even if, (and it’s a big if) there is any significant oil in the Raukumara basin off the East Cape and can be successfully extracted (we’re talking water depths up to 3,000m!) – it will still be of pathetically little direct economic value to New Zealanders. Purely on economic grounds the hydrocarbon economy can’t significantly help New Zealand in the short or long term.  In fact it risks our clean green reputation and, if something does go wrong, the cost to fisheries, coastline, birdlife and other ecology and economy could easily run into tens and tens of billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to questions yesterday on the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster Brownlee &lt;a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3765354/Oil-drilling-deal-off-NZ-a-bad-joke" target="_blank"&gt;reportedly said&lt;/a&gt; that the American incident “has everyone scratching their heads,” and that “Nobody is quite sure exactly what went wrong.”  Let me suggest that what went wrong Mr Brownlee is BP drilled for oil at such a depth that when the blow out happened it was beyond their technical ability to stop the flow of oil.  All the kings’ horses and all the kings’ men type scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question for Mr Brownlee is, “if we can’t stop one oil blowout in the USA then how are we going to stop runaway climate change once the juggernaut of global warming continues its huge momentum thanks to the perpetuation of the hydrocarbon economy?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brownlee’s answer is probably that it’s not our problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History will look back and remember kindly those who where first to move in response to the obvious tide of climate change for both moral and practical reasons – the Gerry Brownlee’s of this world will be parodied.&lt;/p&gt;

	More than 200 people are descending on New Zealand’s largest oil industry conference at dawn this morning and blocking its entrances as part of a Greenpeace-organised demonstration of peaceful civil disobedience.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It‘s the first time in New Zealand that Greenpeace has invited the general public to take civil disobedience action en masse. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/Live-Feed-Real-Climate-Action/"&gt;The day’s activities will be livestreamed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Climate campaigner Steve Abel says despite years of public opposition and a failure to find any deep sea oil, John Key’s Government has continued to invest in the drilling that threatens our communities, coastlines and climate.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The protest comes just days after the announcement that February 2016 was the hottest month in history.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“We have a Government and an oil industry hell-bent on drilling for the very oil that must stay in the ground if we’re going to avoid climate change causing human catastrophe,” says Abel.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Currently, hundreds of people are planning to sit outside the main entrances of SkyCity  in Auckland, where the 2016 Petroleum New Zealand Conference is being held.  Protesters are expected to include Anglican Ministers, nurses, teachers and members of the Tuvaluan community, whose Islands are on the frontline of sea-level rise.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Delegates arriving at the conference will be forced to skulk through basement entrances, step over people lining the pavement and navigate through a series of large red and white cards Greenpeace are calling “Oil Against Humanity”.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The cards, a spin-off of popular cult-like game Cards Against Humanity, pose a series of questions and answers about climate change and the oil industry.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Inside the conference, Minister of Energy and Resources Simon Bridges will announce the 2016 Block Offers – the areas of New Zealand’s ocean that will be on the market for oil exploration this year.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Last year, almost 430,000 square kilometres were opened up for potential drilling.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Abel says that the oil industry can have no future if we are to have any future.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“It’s mad that John Key continues to prop it up. Climate change is the defining struggle of our generation and it needs to be dealt with now. We know that public participation is one of the most effective tools for creating change,” he says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Peaceful civil disobedience has been successfully used throughout history in the face of huge injustices. We’re taking inspiration from people like Gandhi, Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr, and the movements here in New Zealand that opposed apartheid and made us nuclear free.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“In the face of Government and industry inaction it’s going to take people power to secure the future we so urgently need - one that’s run on 100% clean energy.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;-ENDS-&lt;/p&gt;

	As of last month, there was not a single petroleum company searching for oil in New Zealand using exploratory drilling.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace climate campaigner, Simon Boxer, says the news is “extraordinary” and sure to be concerning for the John Key-led Government, which has continued to push an oil agenda here, despite evidence that its programme is failing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Plummeting oil prices have meant that everyone is in a hurry to pull out of the New Zealand market, because despite the hundreds of millions of dollars that has been pumped in by oil companies and by our Government using taxpayer money, no deep sea oil has ever been found,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“No new jobs have been created – in fact many have lost their jobs – and we’ve seen zero economic benefit from it. The revelation that there is currently no exploratory oil drilling in New Zealand at all, anywhere, is extraordinary – it’s a nail in the coffin of Key’s obsession with oil.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s also another sign that the Prime Minister is out of touch with the rest of the world when it comes to climate change and investing in a clean energy future, says Boxer. Unlike the volatile oil market, renewable energy prices are stable and jobs and profit in the sector are growing exponentially.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We’re getting left behind. There’s a new clean economy just around the corner, with new jobs and new prosperity. New Zealand is already rich with natural renewable resources – we’re just not investing in them. Let’s hope this oil failure is enough to knock some sense into our so-called leaders.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-ENDS-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Government subsidies for dairy irrigation schemes should be dropped in order to avert a dairy crisis, Greenpeace says today.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The government currently has around $120million of taxpayers’ money sitting in a fund, called Crown Irrigation Investments, which is earmarked for controversial irrigation schemes designed to expand industrial dairy agriculture. But it is this model of agriculture which is failing, Greenpeace says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The government hopes to increase the amount of taxpayers’ money spent on these schemes to $400million.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Genevieve Toop, Greenpeace’s agriculture campaigner, said:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Industrial agriculture is failing, right before our eyes. It’s failing for Fonterra. It’s failing for Fonterra’s suppliers. It’s failing for our economy. It’s failing for people who like swimming in clean rivers. But, perhaps most importantly, it’s failing for farmers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The government is, right now, sitting on millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money, which they want to throw at the industrial farming model which has led to this sorry situation. There’s no way they should be backing these irrigation schemes, which make no sense economically or environmentally.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Clean, green, organic farming products are much better for our finances, our farmers and our international reputation. It’s this that the government should be backing, not some failed industrial agriculture model which is polluting our rivers and our economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Illegality and criminal wrongdoing in Taiwanese fisheries are increasingly well documented. Yet too often these very serious problems are reported and dealt with by Taiwanese authorities as if they were isolated incidents - the responsibility of individual unscrupulous operators, reckless captains or poorly disciplined foreign crews. This approach serves the Taiwanese Fisheries Agency and the Taiwanese government well. Responsibility remains in the hands of individual wrongdoers.
It is also entirely wrong.

The reality is a global Taiwanese fishing fleet operating almost entirely out of control, in which some of the most serious crimes, including murder, appalling labour abuses, illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and serious environmental impacts, are endemic and routine. This is not a failure of individual operators, but a failure of Taiwan’s authorities at the highest level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taiwan’s fishing fleets supply tuna and other seafood that reaches markets around the world. The issues we highlight in this report are relevant and will be of great interest to consumers in Europe, the US, Japan and many other countries. These consumers demand higher standards than Taiwan can currently provide. Without urgent action to systematically address these problems, Taiwan risks jeopardising its fishing industry and, as importantly, its wider international trading reputation by becoming associated with tuna and seafood caught at terrible human and environmental expense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one wants to see the demise of Taiwan’s fishing fleets but it is clear that a wake-up call is needed for the Taiwanese Fisheries Agency. The threat of European sanctions for IUU looms large – there is a need for far-reaching and sustained action to avoid this. That process of change can only start with an admission: we have a problem that we need to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

	Key’s continued backing for intensive dairy irrigation schemes, which will increase pollution of New Zealand’s rivers and streams, means he is unfit for the tourism job, claims Greenpeace.

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Genevieve Toop, Greenpeace’s agriculture campaigner, said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“John Key should resign as minister of tourism. Any tourism minister worth their salt would be doing all they could to halt the pollution of our rivers and streams. But Key’s not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“He should stop throwing millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money at these irrigation schemes right now, and bring them to a halt. That would be great news for our tourism industry, and to everyone who likes swimming in clean rivers and lakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“But his continued refusal to do so is threatening our huge tourism industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Key’s failing to do his job as minister of tourism. He should do the right thing and resign the position immediately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Clean, green farming is much better for our finances, our farmers and our international reputation, on which our tourism industry relies. It’s this that the government should be backing, not irrigation schemes which pollute our rivers and threaten our economy.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This morning the Tourism Export Council called for a five-year ban on new irrigation schemes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government currently has around $120million of taxpayers’ money sitting in a fund, called Crown Irrigation Investments, which is earmarked for controversial irrigation schemes designed to expand industrial dairy agriculture.

&lt;p&gt;Jef Ikenn is a crew member of the Stop Deep Sea Oil flotilla crew, which represents a coalition of groups that are opposed to the plans to drill for deep sea oil in the Raukūmara Basin off the East Cape. The flotilla is currently in the area to make a stand against that threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tēnā koutou katoa. Ko puke rawhiti te maunga. Ko te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa te moana. Ko kahakura te waka. Nō Kanata me Nōwei ōku tupuna mā, engari tāku whakāro tātou katoa te iwi kotahi. Ko Jef Ikenn tōku ingoa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 30&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We leave in the early hours to join the flotilla with supplies, and then continue the sail to Whangaparāoa Bay at Cape  Runaway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 31&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On arrival in Whitianga, supplies and crew were shuffled between the four vessels sailing to the East  Cape to be welcomed by tangata whenua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sailing vessel &lt;em&gt;Siome&lt;/em&gt;, based in Pēwhairangi/Bay of Islands, has been an integral part of this mission, and my base at sea. At 77ft, &lt;em&gt;Siome&lt;/em&gt; is competently handled by Alan Meyer, owner and skipper with a proud sailing history of protest to protect our environment, including the 2000 Nuclear-Free Tasman flotilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 4pm &lt;em&gt;Siome&lt;/em&gt;, along with the venerable &lt;em&gt;Vega, Secret Affair&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Windborne&lt;/em&gt;, sailed out from Whitianga to the songs and support of 100 locals, into the Bay of Plenty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day continued with the same favourable wind direction and we passed our most active and smoking volcano Whakaari/White Island on our way to Whangaparāoa. Bringing up the rear of the flotilla, we arrived on the southern end of Whangaparāoa at Waihau Bay at five that evening. It was a perfectly still and peaceful scene, as we swam and soaked in the beauty of this pristine part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We lifted anchor and sailed to the shore of Kauaetangohia Marae at the northern end of Whangaparāoa Bay, along with the rest of the flotilla, including the 120 foot &lt;em&gt;Infinity&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once ashore, we turned to a kaitaki/haka leader beckoning us to walk forward towards the pōwhiri area up the beach, and a 100 strong haka by the local people. Words fail to describe the energy, but it can best be described as TU MEKE! Having witnessed countless pōwhiri, I have to say that this one particularly stood out for me as a hononga, a connection between Maori and Tauiwi/Pākehā that must be honoured and strengthened. We have a common passion and goal, and combining our skills and knowledge will make us unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After heartfelt whaikōrero (formal speeches), a prepared poem by the &lt;em&gt;Infinity&lt;/em&gt; crew, and some impromptu words as well, we concluded the formal protocol in the traditional manner with harirū/hongi and kai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long day, people were relocated for a decent rest, and crew returned to their vessels in preparation for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a tangi for a local kuia was already begun earlier in the morning, we needed to pay our respects to the whānau pani/grieving family and the tūpāpaku/body of the deceased, before having our final poroporoaki and departure to our vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We returned to the vessels with knowledge from the locals that the Petrobras contracted vessel, the &lt;em&gt;Orient Explorer,&lt;/em&gt; had left the port of Tauranga, heading to the Raukūmara  Basin to begin its seismic survey. Incidentally this survey is being conducted now in the height of the whale migration season, the route of which passes directly around the East Cape!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand has raised concerns about exploratory drilling operations for deep sea oil that are planned for the summer of 2013/2014 offshore off the west coast of the North Island in the Taranaki Basin, and the east coast of the South Island in the Canterbury Basin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This report provides an evaluation of the likely dispersal trajectory of a deep water oil spill at the two proposed exploration sites. Analysis uses industry standard numerical modelling techniques to conduct an oil-spill trajectory analysis and determine the extent of oil propagation, dispersion and beaching in the event of a deep water blowout.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 10px;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/community_images//77/34977/22033_41982.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="220"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Henk Haazen is the owner/skipper of the yacht Tiama. He gives his perspective on the work of the Flotilla to Stop Deep Sea Oil.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 22 2011  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived at East Cape after a 750 mile, five day journey from Bluff, to join the boats of the Stop Deep Sea Oil flotilla. We were delayed for one day by a 55 knot breeze forcing us to seek shelter before crossing Cook Strait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After rounding East Cape at midnight, at first light we saw a big target on the radar, which we assumed was the seismic survey ship &lt;em&gt;Orient Explorer&lt;/em&gt;. It is surprising how close to land the proposed deep sea oil exploration is. It is no wonder that the local Maori population is so upset about it. It is right in their backyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met up with the other flotilla boats at noon. W&lt;em&gt;indborne&lt;/em&gt; is a traditional gaff-rigged schooner out of Whitianga, a pleasure to the eye to see under full sail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With her was the 40-foot fishing boat &lt;em&gt;San Pietro&lt;/em&gt;, belonging to and manned by the local iwi, te Whanau a Apanui, with one of their tribal leaders on board. They looked great, covered in colourful banners and placards, and were in good spirits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on we talked to the third boat in the flotilla, &lt;em&gt;Siome&lt;/em&gt;, a veteran from previous Nuclear Free Flotilla expeditions out into the Tasman Sea, mounted to stop plutonium passing through our waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We (the three &lt;em&gt;Tiama&lt;/em&gt; crew) are the new boys on the block, and are excited to be here among these veterans of this campaign. The three above boats have been on this campaign for three weeks solid, and we are humbled to be part of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around mid-afternoon the seismic survey ship &lt;em&gt;Orient Explorer&lt;/em&gt; came in view. We sailed along their track and then crossed in front of them, keeping well clear, together with the other flotilla boats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey ship was accompanied by one of the New Zealand navy’s multi-purpose patrol vessels &lt;em&gt;Taupo&lt;/em&gt;, loaded full of police. Later on that day we got a visit from two such policemen, sporting four-day stubble to have that ‘how-tough-it-is-out-here-at-sea’ look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They used the age-old line of every enforcement agency, explaining to us that they were there to “look after our safety”. Yeah right, I have heard that one before. What they are really saying is that we better do as they say otherwise we will be arrested. For this campaign on the high seas they seem to be making the rules up as they go, having effectively said that they had decided that no vessel can come closer than one mile to the side of the big oil company’s survey vessel, and no closer then ½ a mile in front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did ask them on which law that was based - as are outside of the 12 mile NZ territorial limit – but we did not get a clear answer on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this little encounter we took over the role of shadowing the survey a ship, as it does its grid search of the Raukumara Basin. We are bearing witness, as the other flotilla boats have been doing for the last 3 weeks, providing a nagging reminder of our presence, and hopefully making the issue visible to the rest of the New Zealand public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 23&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed the survey vessel all night, to the SW corner of the survey area, where they turned and headed NE again. I asked the skipper of the survey vessel if he could give me the coordinates for where he was going to enter his search grid after the turn, so that we could stay away from his towing cable as he turned, but he said that he did not have those available. He obviously did not want to give them to us, safety coming second.  However, he did advise us when he was going to turn, and its radius. All fun and games I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heading back NE we met up with the rest of the flotilla, and the colourful Whanau a Apanui fishing boat the &lt;em&gt;San Pietro,&lt;/em&gt; the crew of which were fishing in their traditional fishing grounds, which just happened to be right in front of the bow of the oncoming survey vessel, with its six mile tow.  They were asked to move but refused, stating that the survey vessel and Petrobras were not welcome in their waters, and that these waters were for fishing, and not for polluting with oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a good speech and it came from the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the Navy with the New Zealand police on board came on top of them like a ton of bricks, with two semi-rigid inflatables, and about nine guys in it boarding the boat and taking it away from the path of the survey vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We later learned the skipper, Elvis Teddy, was charged under the maritime transport act.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 24&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sailed slowly through the night, keeping a good watch, as the East Cape is a turning point for a lot of shipping, and it is a busy place.  At first light we made our way to where we were expecting the survey vessel to be at in the early afternoon. The three flotilla boats, the NZ Navy patrol vessel &lt;em&gt;Taupo&lt;/em&gt;, the survey vessel &lt;em&gt;Orient Explorer&lt;/em&gt;, and its security boat the &lt;em&gt;Ocean Pioneer,&lt;/em&gt; all met up again. We stayed with them for the rest of the day, until the call was made to sail to Tauranga to avoid the worst of the oncoming bad weather system, and also to support the skipper of the &lt;em&gt;San Pietro&lt;/em&gt;, Elvis Teddy, at his court appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bye for now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henk Haazen, skipper  r/v &lt;em&gt;Tiama&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would stretch  from Wellington to Christchurch and would devastate our coastline and  fisheries for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is now a very real risk as  the Government approves new deep sea oil exploration in NZ waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal  and oil directly cause climate change.  In the era of climate change New  Zealand needs a better vision for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If enough of  us show the Government that we want a future for NZ that includes  investing in clean technologies and not one that sees a return to 19th  century extractive industries like oil drilling and coal mining - we can  steer NZ towards a better future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Click here to take action" href="http://action.greenpeace.org.nz/no-new-oil-petition-gp/" target="_blank"&gt;Click  here to sign the petition calling on the Govt to STOP ALL plans  to open up New Zealand's coastal waters to dangerous offshore oil  drilling and STOP ANY expansion of coal mining in New Zealand.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've  seen a better future, and unlike the NZ Government we have a plan to  get there. It's called the Energy [R]evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's  Energy [R]evolution demonstrates how the world can get from where we are  now, to where we need to be in terms of phasing out fossil fuels,  cutting CO2 whilst ensuring energy security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes  illustrating how the world's carbon emissions from the energy and  transport sectors alone can peak by 2015 and be cut by over 80 percent  by 2050. This phase-out of fossil fuels offers other substantial  benefits such as independence from world market fossil fuel prices as  well as the creation of millions of new green jobs. &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/news/energy-revolution-2010" target="_blank"&gt;You  can read more about the energy revolution here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	Cat owners who buy Whiskas for their pet may unwittingly be funding modern-day slavery and destructive fishing methods, Greenpeace New Zealand says today.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Although most famous for peddling chocolate bars, Whiskas’ owner Mars is also the largest pet food company on the planet. The American company buys tuna and other seafood that goes into its cat food pouches and cans from Thai Union, one of the world’s biggest seafood exporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Last year, Thai Union was exposed as being connected to human rights abuses through direct links to fishing vessels and suppliers where workers were exploited, abused and forced to work on ships for years at a time. Thai Union also sources from fishing methods that result in high catches of untargeted species, such as sharks, turtles and rays. Tuna caught on these ships could be ending up in tins of Whiskas sold in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/world/outlaw-ocean-thailand-fishing-sea-slaves-pets.html?_r=1"&gt;In an exposé&lt;/a&gt; last year, products from another Mars-owned cat food brand, Iams, were shown to be made in a Thai Union cannery which was processing fish from boats using trafficked and forced labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace New Zealand have contacted Mars in New Zealand several times in the last few months, asking the company to provide evidence that they are not selling Whiskas cat food tainted by human rights abuses and destructive fishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Mars have so far failed to provide evidence that their product is not implicated, leading Greenpeace New Zealand to launch a campaign asking cat owners to contact Mars and ask the company to come clean about its Whiskas supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Greenpeace New Zealand campaigner Kate Simcock said: “All too often, modern-day slavery and destructive fishing methods go hand-in-hand. And with these unsavoury elements already lurking in Mars products, it’s clear that Whiskas has some serious questions to answer. Whiskas has so far failed to clear their name on these grave matters, despite clear links to their parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “They've balked at divulging the secrets of their murky supply chain to us, and we’ve seen no evidence that their product is not trashing our oceans and linked to slavery and exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “We’re sure that cat lovers everywhere will be shocked at this. No-one wants to buy cat food, or anything else for that matter, that reeks of human rights abuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s why we’re asking the public to join us and ask Mars a simple question: ‘What’s in my Whiskas?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “Mars have got to tell their customers where they get the fish from that goes into Whiskas. And if it is caught by an exploited workforce, or in ways that empty our oceans of tuna, sharks, turtles and other animals, they’ve got to clean up their act.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Just over three months ago, Nestle, which owns Purina Fancy Feast, admitted that its pet food products have been linked to human rights abuses and promised to clean up its supply chain. Nestle claims that all companies sourcing seafood from Thailand will face the same issues.&lt;/p&gt;

	World-leading environmentalist Bill McKibben is today urging New Zealanders to take part in peaceful civil disobedience to overthrow “radicalism”.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The well-known American has made the call in a &lt;a title="Youtube link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi9Yfe_ez7k&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, which has been released by Greenpeace, five days before members of the public will participate in a Greenpeace-organised demonstration of peaceful civil disobedience at the annual petroleum conference at SkyCity in Auckland.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It will be the first time in New Zealand that Greenpeace has invited the general public to take civil disobedience action en masse.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;McKibben, who founded global climate change organisation &lt;a title="350.org" href="http://350.org/" target="_blank"&gt;350.org&lt;/a&gt;, recorded the video in support of the action on March 21.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a personal message to the New Zealanders taking part, McKibben said:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“We thank you in advance for being willing to stand up peacefully and non-violently to the most violent forces on our planet.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;He says New Zealand is one of the most “beautiful places in the world” but now stands as a place that needs to get serious about the climate crisis.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Everybody went off to Paris [climate conference]. Everybody said lots of sweet things. Everybody pounded each other on the back about what great people they were,” he says.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“[But] if you come home from Paris and say ‘nothing is changing – we’re still going to mine coal, we’re still going to go drill in the deep blue sea for oil, we’re still going to frack’, then you did not get the message.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;On the back of the Paris Climate Conference in December last year, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key stated he had no intention of scaling back any search for fossil fuels.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;McKibben has words of encouragement for Kiwis considering using peaceful civil disobedience as a tactic for change.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The point that you’re trying to get across I think, most importantly, is there’s nothing radical about what we’re talking about. All we’re talking about is trying to keep a world that works a little bit like the world worked for the last 10,000 years,” he says.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The radicals [are the] oil companies and the government ministries that aid and abet that…[It’s] our job, with our bodies if need be, to slow down that radicalism…Civil disobedience is a powerful tactic - it needs to be done with a complete commitment to non-violence and peacefulness.”&lt;/p&gt;

	This report shows that investment in renewables pays off quite quickly due to massive savings in fuel costs. In fact, a 'business as usual' mix in the world global power generation sector would result in 10 times higher fuel costs, when compared to the additional investment needed to implement the energy [r]evolution pathway.

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated: May 2012&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inability of the authorities to cope with the effects of the recent oil spill from the Rena cargo ship, despite the best efforts of Maritime New Zealand, has brought into sharp focus the environmental risks involved in the Government’s decision to open up vast swathes of the country’s coastal waters for deep-sea oil drilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rena accident highlights the devastation that can be caused by what in global terms was actually a relatively small oil spill at 350 tonnes and shows the difficulties of mounting a clean-up operation even when the source of the leaking oil is so close to shore. It raises the spectre of the environmental catastrophe that could occur if an accident on the scale of the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico were to occur in New Zealand’s remote territorial waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential dangers of deep-sea drilling, and the exploration of oil below water depths of 200 metres, have been understood for years. But until recently such dangers were only ever academic as the extraction of deep-sea oil was regarded as prohibitively expensive. In the last few years, however, a combination of declining global oil reserves from traditional sources (1) and rising oil prices worldwide has driven companies to seek out ever riskier sources of oil in order to maintain their revenue streams. And sadly, successive New Zealand governments of different political stripes have shown themselves only too willing to assist.&lt;/p&gt;

	Responding to today’s protests in Auckland ahead of the signing of the controversial TPP deal, Greenpeace executive director Russel Norman said:
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p class="p1"&gt;“Peaceful protest is the beating heart of any democracy. And that’s why today’s peaceful protests in Auckland are so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;“They’re a direct way for people to show their feelings to the politicians and the large corporations, whose interests all too often appear to be in conflict with those of the people. And that’s certainly the case with the TPP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;“I wouldn’t be at all surprised if we see more large-scale peaceful protests in New Zealand this year. When it comes to climate change the government are doing less than bugger all. And this means that we’re facing floods in our homes, and drought on our farms. People don’t want that, and that’s why this could be a year of peaceful protest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	Responding to news that state-owned company Landcorp, the country’s biggest dairy farmer, is set to ditch industrial dairy plans in Waikato, Genevieve Toop, Greenpeace’s agriculture campaigner, said:
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“If you like swimming in clean rivers, and want New Zealand to have an international reputation as a clean, green country, this is great news.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Landcorp are absolutely right. These plans would have resulted in huge amounts of pollution from the dairy industry damaging our rivers and lakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s especially significant that the government’s own dairy farmer is conceding that an expanding dairy industry is not consistent with clean rivers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We simply cannot continue to have an industrial dairy industry like we currently do, and also expect to have clean water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“And that’s why we need to change the way the agricultural industry works. It’s about time we saw more of these polluting plans, including irrigation schemes like Central Plains Water in Canterbury, being ditched.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;
