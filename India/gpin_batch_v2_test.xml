	&lt;p&gt;It started about a month ago with a tiny idea of opposing the genetic modification of crops. The idea came from the trip to Rahuri, a small affected village on the Pune-Mumbai highway. Two members from Hou de Green, the Pune volunteer group, helped out in the protests and got a better insight of the issue which was staring us in the face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what could we do? A tiny group of volunteers in a tiny city? Well, we could have an awareness program? Maybe... but we’d done that before, we needed something bigger and better. But what? We could do a flash mob...and? Maybe a marathon? A small one? Yeah! That sounded good. We could get people to do a marathon in support for the cause! So many people do it, for cancer awareness and for charity, so why not for this cause? We'd also increase our volunteer base that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;Pune volunteers doing a Dance of the Un-dead&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So the goal was set! A marathon, but how do we get people to sign up? A pre event? Obviously, but what could we do? A flash mob! We’d decided on that earlier, hadn’t we? So, after hours invested in selecting a song, we finally zeroed down on "Backstreet's Back." Choreographing the dance and play took up quite a bit of brainstorming and trial and errors. The theme - what better than zombies? Zombies! That's what we'd turn into eating GMO constantly. But at the last moment, we didn't get the zombie masks and we ended up playing what we called the un-dead. Skull masks and an all-black theme did the trick though. Our zombie dance and four minute play paid off quite well. At the end of the day we had about 30 leads! We also earned a few more volunteers through this who proved to be of tremendous help on the 21st December morning, the day of our run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still had our unvoiced insecurities and doubts - would people come? Well, it was worth a shot. The worst scenario would be that we end up running our own marathon! What did we have to lose? Budget plans drawn, seniors consulted, volunteers informed and involved! This would turn out to be the biggest volunteer turn up we've had till date with 17 volunteers and brimming energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content hidden-paragraph"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;24 December 2014&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Sheru starts the marathon!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down this journey there were shortcomings and last moment glitches! We needed to paint posters, our permissions for the run got cancelled. The police noticed that they'd given us and another marathon organiser permission for the same route in the same time frame! On the eve of the marathon. frantic phone calls and tonnes of crossed fingers proved useful and we got our route changed. What kept us all going was the contagious enthusiasm, energy and the mutual goal we shared of taking this plan from paper to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; On the 20th, we worked into the chilly night and not having time to think about the next day, there was too much to be done! Finally crashing for a two hour power nap, the next morning we looked ready to take on the world (with 'Mary had a little lamb' playing in the background).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, all the compilation, assortation, brain raking payed off! We began at 4 am and worked through four hours of blissful organised plans. The number of people who turned up didn’t matter anymore. What mattered were the ones who did turn up. The experience was one of a kind and our cheery mascot was the icing on the cake: Sheru, the tiger, complete with a not-really-waggy-tail!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of the most ambitious projects we’d undertaken, and we pulled through. We made it work, with all the selfies, office dinners, dance moves and giggles we finally had earned ourselves. The day ended with the bananas and biscuits we gobbled after (and with us still smiling over the 5 extra bananas we got for free, courtesy our haggling skills).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is to all of us, to our journey and to the bonds we built on the way. This was a very short blog to sum up everything learnt, felt and shared down the road we ran, giggling and laughing... and of course selfie clicking!&lt;/p&gt;

	A Greenpeace India initiative, the house on wheels, fitted with necessary household appliances running on rooftop solar panels, will tour Delhi to raise awareness and increase uptake of solar power among residents


&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	New Delhi| June 5, 2017| On World Environment Day, Greenpeace India today embarked upon a unique journey. In a drive to create awareness about the benefits of rooftop solar in the Capital, the organisation flagged off Solar Comet --a unique house on wheels with solar panels fitted on the roof, that demonstrates how solar power can easily run an entire household.
&lt;span&gt;Lit up with power saving led bulbs, the Solar Comet houses mobile charging points, a mixer grinder, an air cooler, a refrigerator, and even an air conditioner. In the next 20 days the Solar Comet would tour across the length and breadth of the city interacting with various Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) spreading awareness about the benefits of rooftop solar panels.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;“The Delhi government came up with Delhi’s Solar policy last year. But despite the benefits that it offers, Delhiites haven’t really woken up to the idea.Till now the uptake has been very low residential sectors,” says Pujarini Sen, climate and energy campaigner, Greenpeace India.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Delhi’s total solar potential is 2,500 MW with a residential potential of 1,250 MW. The official target in Delhi is to reach 1,000 MW worth solar installations by 2020 and 2,000 MW by 2025. But as of December 2016, only 35.9 MW have been installed out of which, only 3 MW were residential installations in March 2016.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;“We hope that the solar bus is able to play its part in encouraging more and more residents to go solar. In our initial talks with RWAs, we discovered that there are several myths about rooftop solar that need to be busted. There’s a widespread belief that rooftop solar requires a very high capital investment, but with the benefits that have been offered by the state and the central government, it’s not a problem anymore,” says Sen.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;In Delhi, a 30 percent national incentive offered by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). Besides this, grid connectivity through net metering allows a consumer to sell the excess amount of electricity generated to the main grid and save up on their electricity bills. “One can break even on their investment in four to five years. The solar panels have a life of 25 years and require very low maintenance,” she explains.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Roof rights are a common problem faced by people living in apartments, where the rooftop is usually owned by the family living on the top floor. “In such cases, the RWAs can take a collective decision to install a solar power system in the common areas of the colony,” says Sen citing the example of Rishi Apartments in Alaknanda, Delhi, where residents have pledged to install a 21 kWp system.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;“All we need is an open mind,” she says. “Rooftop solar is an environment friendly alternative to coal powered electricity. It has been proven time and again that thermal power plants are a primary source of air pollution causing 1.2 million deaths every year. Delhi is the most polluted city in India and a small initiative to go solar can make the city a little more breathable,” she adds.&lt;/span&gt;

The embassy of Junglistan was set up  at Cubbon park, a place known for its preserved green cover. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Soon,  Bhaloo and Sheroo were surrounded by a lot of their young friends.  Almost 70 school children from 3 different schools came to meet their  friends. We were also joined by enthusiastic differently-abled children.  Together they painted, played with Bhaloo and Sheroo and proudly called  themselves citizens of Junglistan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;It  is always invigorating to work with students, because the hope and the  abundant radiance of positivity that they bring are contagious.  It  makes you believe that even the most daunting task is possible to  accomplish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 1px; border: 0.5px solid black;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/54/57254/30720_60253.jpg" alt="School children with Bhaloo and Sheroo in Cubbon park" width="390" height="260"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;It  was beautiful to see the young green warriors take charge and interest in the forests of our country. But what are we leaving for  them? A planet without forests, without real Sheroos or Bhaloos? We  can’t let coal mining in Central India destroy the future of these  bright and happy faces. It’s our responsibility to ensure that we give  them a green, beautiful and sustainable planet, like it’s meant to be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Bhaloo  and Sheroo are here to save their beautiful Republic of Junglistan, the  land of the forests, from destruction. They are offering citizenship to  their country hoping that the new citizens will help them save their  home, their forests, their Junglistan.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;They  will be in Bangalore for some more time. So don’t be surprised if you  spot them somewhere in the city soon! Even if you don’t, help them out  by giving a &lt;strong&gt;missed call to 080-49311109&lt;/strong&gt; or just &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Templates/Planet3/Pages/After%20meeting%20people%20in%20Mumbai,%20Delhi%20and%20Chennai,%20Bhaloo%20and%20Sheroo%20finally%20reached%20Bangalore,%20the%20Garden%20City.%20The%20embassy%20of%20Junglistan%20was%20set%20up%20at%20Cubbon%20park,%20a%20place%20known%20for%20its%20preserved%20green%20cover.%20%20Soon,%20Bhaloo%20and%20Sheroo%20were%20surrounded%20by%20a%20lot%20of%20their%20young%20friends.%20Almost%2070%20school%20children%20from%203%20different%20schools%20came%20to%20meet%20their%20friends.%20We%20were%20also%20joined%20by%20enthusiastic%20differently-abled%20children.%20Together%20they%20painted,%20played%20with%20Bhaloo%20and%20Sheroo%20and%20proudly%20called%20themselves%20citizens%20of%20Junglistan.%20%20It%20is%20always%20invigorating%20to%20work%20with%20students,%20because%20the%20hope%20and%20the%20abundant%20radiance%20of%20positivity%20that%20they%20bring%20are%20contagious.%20%20It%20makes%20you%20believe%20that%20even%20the%20most%20daunting%20task%20is%20possible%20to%20accomplish.%20%20It%20was%20beautiful%20to%20see%20the%20young%20green%20warriors%20take%20charge%20and%20take%20interest%20in%20the%20forests%20of%20our%20country.%20But%20what%20are%20we%20leaving%20for%20them?%20A%20planet%20without%20forests,%20without%20real%20Sheroos%20or%20Bhaloos?%20We%20can%E2%80%99t%20let%20coal%20mining%20in%20Central%20India%20destroy%20the%20future%20of%20these%20bright%20and%20happy%20faces.%20It%E2%80%99s%20our%20responsibility%20to%20ensure%20that%20we%20give%20them%20a%20green,%20beautiful%20and%20sustainable%20planet,%20like%20it%E2%80%99s%20meant%20to%20be.%20%20Bhaloo%20and%20Sheroo%20are%20here%20to%20save%20their%20beautiful%20Republic%20of%20Junglistan,%20the%20land%20of%20the%20forests,%20from%20destruction.%20They%20are%20offering%20citizenship%20to%20their%20country%20hoping%20that%20the%20new%20citizens%20will%20help%20them%20save%20their%20home,%20their%20forests,%20their%20Junglistan.%20%20%20%20They%20will%20be%20in%20Bangalore%20for%20some%20more%20time.%20So%20don%E2%80%99t%20be%20surprised%20if%20you%20spot%20them%20somewhere%20in%20the%20city%20soon!%20Even%20if%20you%20don%E2%80%99t,%20help%20them%20out%20by%20giving%20a%20missed%20call%20to%20080-49311109%20or%20just%20click%20here%20to%20become%20a%20citizen%20of%20Junglistan.%20" target="_blank"&gt;click here to become a  citizen of Junglistan.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;If  you are not a citizen of Junglistan yet, you are missing out on a lot  of things. For one thing is certain, the Republic of Junglistan is a  country that never sleeps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Why this Koyla (coal) mining di?"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just  before 2011 ended, Sheroo and Bhaloo, from the Republic of Junglistan,  came up with their version of the chartbuster 'Kolaveri di'. Sheroo lent his vocals and Bhaloo played the music, and with the help  of some other citizens of Junglistan they recorded 'Why this Koyla  mining di'. Take a look but do come back to this blog because I have  more to tell you about the happening Junglistan (Hint: Abhay Deol).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TfFP9ld4UJY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With  this video Sheroo and Bhaloo have shot to instant stardom. If rumours  are to be believed, they might be seen in a big budget Indian film soon.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abhay Deol joins the Republic of Junglistan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While  Sheroo and Bhaloo are probably becoming favourites in the Indian film  industry, the Republic of Junglistan has a new favourite from the same  industry. Ask anyone in Junglistan who their favourite actor is, and  they will not take a second to tell you, it's Abhay Deol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  actor joined the citizens of Junglistan in the forests of Mahan in  Madhya Pradesh this week. These beautiful forests are also threatened by  coal mining. Abhay Deol went on-board the hot-air balloon which flew  over these lush-green forests. He was accompanied by a team from the  television news channel Times Now and a Greenpeace campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking  down at the vast forest, Abhay told the journalists about the urgent  need to save these forests. He said that allowing coal mining in Mahan  will only open up the entire forest area to be destroyed for coal .   Watch Abhay Deol fly over the forests of Mahan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gqVo3M7TRKM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some  people from the companies that promote coal mining were not happy with  all this talk about saving forests. So they disrupted the proceedings  and the citizens of Junglistan and Abhay Deol had to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They  are safe, and are on their way back to the hum-drum of the cities.  They'll have a lot of stories to tell once they come back. Become a  citizen of Junglistan and get your friends to join, if you and your  friends don't want to miss out on all the exciting happenings to save  the Republic of Junglistan that will be told here soon.&lt;/p&gt;

	The miracle wasn’t caused by any divine intervention but by the sheer determination of Greenpeace India and the residents of Dharnai who came together to make the impossible happen.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dharnai, Bihar &lt;/strong&gt;— July 20, 2014 will go down in the history of Dharnai revenue village in Bihar as a day of triumph and celebration. After over 30 years of life without power, Dharnai now owns and operates its own electricity production system located right inside the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The miracle wasn’t caused by any divine intervention but by the sheer determination of Greenpeace India and the residents of Dharnai who came together to make the impossible happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had tried everything in the book to get electricity for the last 30 years. But we haven’t seen a single ray of hope. While India was growing by leaps and bounds, we were stuck here with kerosene lamps and expensive diesel generators. But now I can proudly say that Dharnai is a leader in innovation,” said Kamal Kishore Prasad, resident and Village Electricity Committee chairman of Bishunpur Tolla, Dharnai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microgrid has been set up with the approval and participation of the people of Dharnai. The 100-kilowatt (kW) microgrid is a comprehensive, first of its kind enterprise that provides 70 kW power for household purposes and 30 kW for 10 solar-powered water-pumping systems of three horsepower each. It also takes care of 60 street lights, energy requirements of two schools, one health centre, one Kisan Training Centre and 50 commercial establishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project has been initiated and funded by Greenpeace India and operated with the help of BASIX, a livelihood promotion institution, and Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED), which is a network of NGOs and think-tank organisations in Bihar that support renewable energy development in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The microgrid intends to be the answer to the intense policy and vision paralysis that India’s energy sector faces today,” said Naveen Mishra of CEED. “The towns and villages of Bihar have been deprived of energy for decades and we feel this is where the microgrid can be the connect. We urge the Bihar government to follow and replicate this model.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the launch of the microgrid, Dharnai has set the stage for more than 300 million Indian citizens to follow its example and declare their energy-independence from the centralised power grid that has left them in the dark for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “Even as the government is preoccupied with blaming civil society for stopping energy projects, here is a village that has created its own energy pathway through an alternate model of sustainable energy,” said Samit Aich, Executive Director, Greenpeace India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decentralised, expandable and sustainable approach of the microgrid is a critical catalyst to power up growth in rural villages like Dharnai, as well as bridge the deficit in urban areas, according to Greenpeace India. This solution can be integrated in the current government’s renewable energy agenda for energy access to every household by 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The coal-fired and nuclear-based power plants of the country will not be able to reach the Dharnais of the country. Nor will they be able to address global climate concerns and India’s commitments towards those concerns,” Aich said. “India needs to seriously reconsider its energy strategy and prioritise renewable energy for social and climate justice.” &lt;/p&gt;

	India is a country where the centralised grid system for electricity has dominated the last 60 years and, largely, failed.


In the cities blackouts are frequent, in the rural areas there is often no power at all. The grid doesn’t provide energy access to more than a third of the rural population. Despite a growing economy India as whole is an energy starved country with the national average of 879 kWh per person compared to the UK which is close to 4500 kWh.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/image/2014/GP0STOGQS_press.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1667"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;India’s most energy starved state, Bihar supports a population of 103 million with just 130 kWh per person.  In this very state more than 89% of people live in rural communities and close to 95% of this population either has no access to power or is dependent on kerosene and firewood for primary electricity needs.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Village scheme&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Dharnai, a moderately sized village of 2500, has been powerless for 30 years when the grid was cut off due to power shortages. On the 20th July it became India’s first village to secure 24/7 power from a solar micro grid. The idea is for it to serve as a case study for others.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;This cluster based micro-grid runs off a 70 kW peak roof mounted solar photovoltaic system located at four different clusters, each with individual battery banks to keep the power on when the sun sets.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Independent of this 60 solar street lights illuminate the 5 km pathway that connects the village and 10 solar based water pumps have been installed which will be used for irrigation purposes by the farmers.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;The entire setup is state of the art with complete LED fixtures and domestically manufactured Grade A panels and batteries. The entire set-up took around 3 months to install and start functioning.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;So far 250 households have become official consumers of this micro-grid and local volunteers are expecting that the entire 450 will enrolled by the end of next month. The system caters to about 450 households, 50 small shops (commercial setup), 2 schools and a health care center with revenues from the panels used to fund the operation and maintenance of the system.  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;India offers a solar tariff of 0.08 -0.10 pound per unit (kWh) for the residential consumer ,0.126 pound/unit for the commercial and finally for the irrigation systems its close to 0.35 pound  per hour depending on the consumption.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;15% Target&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;span&gt;The activists and villagers who set up the scheme hope it can be a case study for others - but India isn’t yet pioneering distributed energy.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;In 2009 the country said it wanted  to source 15% of it’s power from renewable energy by 2020, it’s currently at 8% (30GW), largely thanks to 21GW of large-scale wind projects. Much of the projected growth is similar, more wind and a startling additional 20GW of solar, with 2.5GW to be added next year. Recently the new Indian President, Modi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://reneweconomy.com.au/2014/modi-accelerates-india-solar-revolution-doubles-tax-on-coal-57890"&gt;&lt;span&gt;indicated he wants to go much further&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; - embracing the tools used in Dharnai.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;The growth in renewables is matched - or even surpassed - by plans for an expansion of the coal sector in India. The industry is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/newsdesk/energy/analysis/modhi%E2%80%99s-hard-place-nexus-energy-corruption-and-climate-change"&gt;&lt;span&gt;currently mired in corruption scandals amids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;t ongoing concerns of blackouts due to coal shortages. For Modi, who came to power on a promise of keeping the lights on, the question is - how will he do it?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<item><subtitle>US complaints undermine India’s Renewable Energy plans, violate the spirit of the Paris Agreement</subtitle><tags>renewables</tags><text>&lt;h2&gt;US complaints undermine India’s Renewable Energy plans, violate the spirit of the Paris Agreement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	February 26, 2016 | Washington/New Delhi: India’s plans for meeting its ambitious renewable energy targets while boosting the national green job market have received a setback this week. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) has sided with the United States and ruled against India’s allocation of domestic content requirements (DCR) for domestically produced components in renewable energy projects. Essentially, the WTO ruling declares the DCR initiative as giving Indian manufacturers an ‘unfair trade advantage’, rather than recognising it as a significant long term incentive to encourage the manufacturing of solar panels in India. (Footnote 1)
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace India and Greenpeace USA have criticised the ruling in a joint statement, and expressed support for the Indian government’s decision to appeal the ruling. (2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“India’s setting of the DCR was based on a worthy core principle: increasing economic opportunities and creating thousands of green jobs in India while taking critically important steps in the global fight against climate change. It is ridiculous that the WTO does not recognise this principle, and points to the danger to developing countries that such international trade regimes pose,” said Pujarini Sen, campaigner, Greenpeace India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The international environmental organisation is simultaneously calling on the US to stay true to its own previously stated position: the US government has repeatedly stressed the need for other major polluters, including India, to move away from their dependence on coal and towards a low carbon future. Pursuing this WTO challenge could hamper India’s ambitious solar programme when it starts to do precisely that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US position at the WTO is also particularly hypocritical as the US implements similar domestic content requirements and subsidies to strengthen the renewable energy sector within its own borders. (3) Most US states have LCR requirements and subsidies, making India’s DCR very much in keeping with accepted industry practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If President Obama wants the US to be a global leader on climate change, he must instruct his officials to drop any opposition to clean energy initiatives in other countries, starting with India’s ambitious 100GW solar programme,” said Kelly Mitchell, Climate Campaign Director, Greenpeace US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the national climate plan announced ahead of the UNFCCC global summit held in Paris in December 2015, the Indian Government had announced a robust renewable energy target of 175 GW by 2022, of which 100 GW will be realised through the National Solar Mission. (4) By August 2015, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy had already laid out a year by year timeline, that formed a core part of India’s INDC submissions under UNFCCC. India crossed 5GW of installed solar capacity in December 2015, while placing itself to be one of the leaders in solar energy internationally, that’s included the formation of the International Solar Alliance of Solar Rich Countries by Prime Minister Modi at the Paris COP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India also tried to meet the US halfway by proposing that they would not DCR for commercial use, and buy solar panels with such requirements for it’s own consumption only, such as railways and defence. Though this would only be a small percentage of the solar programme, the US was still not appeased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The WTO ruling - and the US decision to pursue it - is a setback to India’s renewable energy ambitions. By challenging this decision, the Indian government is demonstrating commitment to India’s fledgling solar manufacturing sector, which needs initial support to enable it to compete with the price of imported products, and to its own roadmap for a green economy solution to global climate change,” concluded Sen.&lt;/p&gt;

	Patna, 4 August: In a thumbs-up to Greenpeace’s solar-powered micro-grid, former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday visited Dharnai village in Jehanabad district, where the micro grid has been setup. Elated to see homes, shops and streets lit up at night, Kumar praised Greenpeace and the unique energy model, upholding it as a crucial step towards rural electrification of Bihar.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="638" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nitish speaks on Greenpeace’s solar micro-grid in Dharnai village:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Solar is the real energy as it is non depleting, Solar energy is here to stay.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Solar energy is the only solution &amp;amp; I praise and appreciate Greenpeace for accepting the challenge in successfully installing this everlasting viable solution model.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Coal is a limited resource and eventually it will deplete, and Renewable, as the name suggest is the energy future.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“In the meeting with Greenpeace back in May 16th 2012, I recommended them to install the micro grid model in one village of Bihar, and see here Greenpeace has successfully delivered its promise.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We are destroying our environment and we usually are unaware about it. We must appreciate Greenpeace’s effort to safeguard our environment.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; In a meeting between Nitish Kumar and Greenpeace on 16 May, 2012, the then chief minister had suggested that Greenpeace should display the viability of a clean energy micro-grid through a pilot project that his government was willing to replicate across the state. “Billion units of electricity is produced in this country everyday but it never reaches the villages and towns of poor states like Bihar because they are not connected to the country’s energy infrastructure or the national grid. To stop this energy injustice, Greenpeace had advocated to the Bihar government that it must not depend on central power supply but produce its own electricity at smaller, village-levels using clean energy,” Manish Ram, Senior Campaigner, Renewable Energy, Greenpeace India, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the public function in the village, Dr. Shaibal Gupta, Secretary, ADRI, said, “It is very encouraging to see that Greenpeace has successfully demonstrated the viability of renewable energy by setting up a micro-grid that provides clean power to an entire village. This will definitely play a vital role in transforming the energy sector of Bihar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built at a cost of Rs 3 crore, the 100kW micro-grid in Dharnai provides 24x7 electricity to 450 households, 50 commercial establishments, 60 streetlights, two schools, one health centre and one Kisan Training Centre. Besides this, 10 solar irrigation pumps also run on the micro-grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We hope that after witnessing the merit of this project, the state government would fulfill its promise of replicating Dharnai-like models across the state and deliver power to all those who are currently living without it,” said Ram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home to one of India’s most fertile lands and a large labour force, Bihar has the potential to become the country’s next centre of agricultural and industrial growth. However, lack of electricity continues to remain a critical issue, posing as an impediment in the growth of Bihar. But with Nitish Kumar’s visit to Dharnai, the state government has reaffirmed its commitment and willingness to adopt models that can quickly overcome Bihar’s severe energy crunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeline – From darkness to light in two years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Patna, 4 August: In a thumbs-up to Greenpeace’s solar-powered micro-grid, former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday visited Dharnai village in Jehanabad district, where the micro grid has been setup. Elated to see homes, shops and streets lit up at night, Kumar praised Greenpeace and the unique energy model, upholding it as a crucial step towards rural electrification of Bihar.

	Brikesh Singh, who is living on a tree in Chandrapur, had a special visitor recently. Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, the Member of Parliament from the Chandrapur constituency came over to Brikesh’s tree house on September 22 and was all praise for his endeavour to save Central Indian forests from coal mining. Brikesh has been living in the tree house on the fringes of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra since September 1, 2012. But this was the first time that a Parliamentarian expressed his support for Brikesh’s tree-top protest. 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Ahir is well known in Maharashtra for his special interest in&lt;strong&gt; e&lt;/strong&gt;nvironmental protection. He has even fought against the coal lobby in Maharashtra. In fact, he played a pivotal role in exposing the coal scam by writing a letter to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) in 2010, asking them to investigate coal mining in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;div class="events-content"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;25 September 2012&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Chandrapur MP Hansraj Gangaram Ahir with Brikesh Singh at Junglistan Nivas
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Parliamentarian understood the campaign well and also strongly supported the demand for a moratorium on allocating coal mines in forests. He was also thrilled to see clean energy being used to power the tree house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, “I admire what Brikesh Singh is doing to save the forests and appreciate the fact that the tree house is fitted with solar panels for power. This is a multi-dimensional campaign, not just raising awareness against coal, but also veering the focus towards solar energy. It is about time that the Central government looks towards renewable energy as an alternative to coal. It should avoid allocating coal blocks on forest land.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of Greenpeace’s Junglistan campaign is precisely that and Brikesh’s tree top protest is meant to garner more attention to this important issue. Coal mining in the forests of Central India will destroy forests, indigenous forest communities, tigers and other wildlife. It will continue to cause environmental damage like air and water pollution while also increasing carbon emissions.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brikesh who has been in the forest for three weeks now has been keeping in touch with supporters through blogs, social media and videos. He has been asking people to sign the online petition addressed to the Prime Minister asking him to stop all coal block allocations in forest areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 90,000 people have already signed the petition and with signatures of people who have shown support for forests in the past year, the number is over 200,000.  Brikesh will deliver all these signatures to the PM in October at the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) that India is hosting in Hyderabad.  Brikesh said, “We are losing these forests to the greed of private mining companies and the corrupt system. India cannot host the convention on bio-diversity and at the same time turn a blind eye to this destruction. Mr Ahir has assured us today that the Parliamentarians will take up this issue up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also added that the visit by the MP has boosted his morale and has added a fresh energy to this cause. It is very significant that an MP is willing to stand up to support this campaign and create more awareness among his colleagues. Our forests, wildlife and indigenous forest communities need a lot more support from the individuals in power. Brikesh rightly points out, “Our leaders need to ensure that they fulfil their responsibility to protect the rights of forest communities and wildlife and if certain government policies compromise on these rights then they should take the lead in rejecting them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support Brikesh Singh and help protect the last remaining forests in Central India sign the petition at &lt;a title="www.junglistan.org/home" href="http://www.junglistan.org/home" target="_blank"&gt;www.junglistan.org/home&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Clean Air Nation app by Greenpeace India empowers users to find out the quality of air they are breathing and more importantly, how to protect themselves on bad polluted days and what actions government should take to protect public health.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India is home to 13 out of 20 most polluted cities in the world according to a World Health Organisation report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the app is simple, you can visit Google Play store and download it at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.gonative.android.robzl"&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.gonative.android.robzl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shivanandan L, Technology Manager at Greenpeace India, explained why he created this application,“35% of school going children are affected by the dangers of the pollution they are living with every day: as a father myself, I wanted to do something to highlight these dangers. The obvious solution to this ever-mounting problem would surely be to tackle the problem of air pollution by reducing emissions at sources. But I’m afraid that’s not likely to happen quickly – and certainly not unless people show their expectations from the government, and demand an end to this exposure they suffer. I’m a tech minded guy – so my response to the problem was rooted in a techy approach: I wanted to see if we could build a tech solution that would put more power into people’s hands. I set out to design something that would allow people to register their concerns, check for new, current information about the quality of air in their cities, and if that data is missing, have a way to demand it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A web friendly version of the app is ready to use at:&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.in/cleanairnation/p4/"&gt; http://act.greenpeace.in/cleanairnation/p4/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the user downloads the app, they can go through the different cities’ air quality data as provided by the NAQI (National Air Quality Index). Depending on the quality of the air, the app will give users precautionary measures for different various groups (children, elders and pregnant women).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to editors: As this is a new way of campaigning for Greenpeace India, and we are our first foray into the technology and innovation space, we invite you to test this beta version and provide us feedback so that we can continue to improve the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Guide to the App&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose the state and city from the dropdown menu list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose your closest station from the second drop down list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users will be given precautionary measures for six different categories as listed below&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users will be given information on health alert, recommendations for government action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the data for a city/ station does not show up then users are directed to the Clean Air Nation campaign page, where they can sign a petition asking the govt to set up air monitoring stations and provide information on air quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icon 1 - About me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the air healthy enough to for me go outdoors? On extremely polluted days, it may or may not be okay to head outdoors, and it’s important to know how the users can protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icon 2 - Elderly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2015/Air%20Pollution%20v%202.0/24CAN_FB%20Post_10Nov15-07.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="242"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the air healthy for the elderly to head out side? The elderly are more susceptible to health problems than other groups and this category can help your parents, grandparents and elderly relatives to plan their time out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Icon 3 - Babies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can infants and babies be taken outdoors? Babies are sensitive to changes externally and special care needs to be taken if they are going outdoors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Icon 4 - Pregnant women&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2015/Air%20Pollution%20v%202.0/24CAN_FB%20Post_10Nov15-02.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="242"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the air healthy enough for pregnant women? They are at risk from breathing in polluted air as it has direct implications on the development of the baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Icon 5 - Patients with respiratory disorders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2015/Air%20Pollution%20v%202.0/24CAN_FB%20Post_10Nov15-05.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="242"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it okay for patients to go out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with respiratory disorders may experience further problems if they are outdoors in polluted air. Precautionary measures will help this sensitive group to plan if they should head outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"&gt;Icon 6 - Mask precaution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2015/Air%20Pollution%20v%202.0/24CAN_FB%20Post_10Nov15-06.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="242"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I be wearing a N95 ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app has a special section usage of N95 masks, which come with a carbon filter and help in filtering the polluted air for breathing. This icon gives suggestions to users if they should be using the N95 mask to go outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: text-top; margin: 4px 1px; border: 1px solid black;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/54540_103056.jpg" alt="Brikesh Singh in the forest"&gt;I had been excited for days for two reasons: TEDx was being hosted in Coimbatore and Greenpeace activist, Brikesh Singh agreed to be a speaker at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stage was set and the speakers were getting ready. I was waiting with bated breath for Brikesh to get on stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was time for Brikesh's talk, all we could hear was the sound of a lizard sucking in its prey but there was no Brikesh in sight! Shortly after, he stepped up on stage and began his talk entitled 'Junglistan Diaries'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire idea of spending a month on a tree around the edge of Tadoba forest reserve in Chandrapur originated when Greenpeace India began to highlight the dangers of coal mining in India's forests in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 1px 10px; border: 1px solid black;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/80266_129130.jpg" alt="Brikesh at Tedx" width="283" height="373"&gt;Brikesh spoke about the tree house and how it became his home for over a month. He spoke about the 'fish pedicures' he got for free every day. He said, "Nothing goes waste in the forest. The food chain is well kept, under no supervision."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had made friends with a bunch of children who would come to play in the forest next to his tree house. One of the children had cooked him "bamboo ki bhajji" using bamboos from the forest. There also came a day when a leopard took halt on a tree near Brikesh's tree house. He was quite sure that the animal would have sensed his presence but neither seemed to fear the other. They existed all together, the way it's supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of his stay, an elderly man had travelled to the Tadoba reserve just to show his support for Greenpeace India and its cause. Brikesh said that he was more optimistic and positive towards his cause, once he knew there was public backing him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was watching a young environmentalist, his head held high and eyes filled with the love for nature. It was a pleasure to listen to him. I could almost experience being in the forest- its sights and sounds, as the slides went on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I had read about "Junglistan", signed petitions, shared it, got some friends on board too but it was just overwhelming to listen to the whole experience from the "Junglistani" himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<item><subtitle>Moratorium on forest clearances needed, says Greenpeace</subtitle><tags>forest</tags><text>&lt;h2&gt;Moratorium on forest clearances needed, says Greenpeace&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	August 1, 2012, New Delhi/Bhubaneswar: Even as the environment ministry continues to come under renewed pressure to fast track coal mining in forest areas, a GIS analysis released by Greenpeace titled “How Coal Mining is Trashing Tigerland” shows that coal mining threatens over 1.1 million hectares of forest in 13 coalfields alone in Central India. (1) 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The analysis, conducted by the Geoinformatics Lab at ATREE (Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment) overlaid maps of the 13 coalfields (2) with forest cover, Protected Area boundaries and the latest government data on tiger, elephant and leopard presence. Almost all the coalfields overlap with endangered species habitat - of the 1.1 million hectares of forest at risk, over 185,000 ha. are inhabited by tiger, over 270,000 ha. by leopard and over 55,000 ha. by elephants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stating that the blackout in Northern India is not a reason to fast-track coal projects, Ashish Fernandes, Coal Campaigner with Greenpeace said, “The black-out is a wake-up call for the government to revisit its unsustainable energy policy. We need to diversify our power generation sources as well as our distribution model – Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency can no longer be given step motherly treatment. Locking the country into a coal intense pathway is going to be disastrous for the country, and will not guarantee us power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report highlights the massive costs India is facing from the huge expansion in coal mining. Forest corridors connecting eight tiger reserves – including some of India’s finest such as Tadoba-Andhari, Kanha and Bandhavgarh - are at risk.(3) These corridors have been identified by the government’s own Tiger Conservation Authority as essential for the species’ long term survival, yet they also face the threat of coal mining from the Coal Ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace warned that this analysis is the tip of the iceberg as there are approximately 40 coalfields in the central Indian region, many of them in forest areas. “This study focuses on coal mining’s impact on mega fauna, but the loss of forests is also going to hit the communities dependent on them hard. The era of cheap coal is over – across India, from mine to power plant, communities are questioning coal as a source of electricity and asking for sustainable alternatives.” added Fernandes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Prime Minister’s Office and the Group of Ministers dismissed the ‘Go/No Go’ policy on coal mining in forest areas, the coal lobby has been demanding that the Ministry of Environment approve all coal mining proposals in forest areas. In April 2012, Environment Minister Jayanthi Natarajan refuted the charge that her ministry was to blame for the power shortage faced by the country, stating that the clearances granted by her Ministry for coal mining and coal-fired power plants in fact surpass the Indian government’s own targets till 2017.(4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Ministry of Environment continues to clear coal power projects and mines way beyond requirements, often over-riding the objections of its own officials and committees. We are asking for an immediate moratorium on all new forest clearances, until the criteria for determining forests off limits to mining are agreed on and implemented, with proper public consultation and input,” said Biswajit Mohanty of Wildlife Society of Orissa and member of the National Board Wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also identifies key corporate players in each coalfield, and warns that securing clearances for coal mining in forest areas is going to be more difficult as the level of scrutiny by civil society increases. As part of a public mobilization drive, Greenpeace is collecting signatures on a petition to the Prime Minister demanding that he ensure the protection of forests in Central India from coal mining. Individuals can sign this petition at www.junglistan.org/home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The complete report with      maps for each coalfield is available at &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 13 coalfields are:      Singrauli, Sohagpur, Sonhat, Tatapani, Hasdeo-Arand, Mandraigarh, Auranga,      North Karanpura, W. Bokaro, Talcher, Ib      Valley, Wardha, Kamptee &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The eight tiger      reserves impacted by coalfields in this analysis are: Kanha, Bandhavgarh,      Sanjay Dubri, Tadoba-Andhari, Kawal, Satkosia, Simlipal and Palamau.&lt;/li&gt;

	On the eve of Quit India Day, August 8, over 2,000 citizens from 20 states came together at Jantar Mantar, Delhi for a day-long protest and march demanding that GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) and multinational seed giant, Monsanto quit India. The delegation marched to Parliament also asking the government to withdraw the BRAI (Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India) bill 2013. An Indian flag made out of organic cotton, which does not come from Monsanto's patented cotton seed, was an important symbol of the event. This flag was later gifted to the Prime Minister's delegate, urging him to unfurl this non-Bt cotton flag on Independence Day.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protest comes after the Union government recently introduced the BRAI Bill, 2013 in Parliament in the last budget session. This Bill has been facing strong opposition inside parliament and outside as it will facilitate the fast track entry of GM food crops into our agriculture. The Bill proposes to set up a centralised single window clearance system which is designed to lower the bar for GM crop approvals with no independent long-term safety assessments or need assessment of a particular GM product. It also takes away the decision-making power of state governments on open field trials in their states. Furthermore, it proposes to override the RTI Act. The bill is currently under review of the Parliamentary Standing committee on Science and Technology, Environment and Forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the protest, Neha Saigal, Sustainable Agriculture Campaigner at Greenpeace India said, "The BRAI Bill is India's Monsanto Protection and Promotion Act, it will give a free hand to Monsanto and other Biotech giants to control our food security and endanger small farmer livelihoods. In order to protect our seed sovereignty it is important that notorious corporations like Monsanto along with their controversial GM technology Quit India."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The gathering also urged farmers in the country to follow the path of agro-ecological farming in consonance with nature and also with due recognition for women farmers. They also urged the government stop promoting GMOs and invest urgently in sustainable agricultural solutions to ensure food and livelihood security. The main demand was that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment and Forests recommend to the government that the BRAI bill be withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajesh Krishnan, Co-Convenor of the Coalition for a GM Free India said, "At this critical juncture in Indian agriculture, clearing the BRAI Bill to ensure speedy clearance for GMOs will be detrimental to the interests of our citizens. Indian cotton farmers have already experienced the devastating consequences of the takeover of their seeds and fields by Monsanto through its proprietary Bt cotton. We can't surrender our food and farming to the onslaught of GMOs and multinational seed companies like Monsanto. Seed is a matter of sovereignty and this is our struggle to ensure that others don't take control over our seeds and food".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The persistence of the protestors ensured that a delegation from among them met with V. Narayanasamy, the Minister of State in the Prime Ministers Office. He was given the organic flag and memorandum asking the government to withdraw the BRAI bill and uphold the country's seed sovereignty by rejecting GM crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pointing to the increasing evidence on the negative impacts of GM crops, Kavitha Kuruganti of Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture (ASHA) also present at the event, said "The final report of the Technical Expert Committee (TEC) of Supreme Court has clearly stated that open air field trials of GM crops needs to be stopped and the effort to introduce biotechnology in food crops is not advisable. Even last year the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture (PSC) emphasised that protection of biosafety is of paramount importance and it asked for the creation of a comprehensive biosafety protection authority instead of the current BRAI. Why is the government ignoring these highly credible reports and promoting GMOs and pushing the flawed BRAI Bill?"&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The protesters also demanded that all the political parties should pay heed to the democratic voices that are opposing GMOs in our food and farming and declare their commitment to ecological farming, and take a firm stand against GMOs in our food, farming and environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, cutting across party lines senior leaders from various political parties including BJP, Congress, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India, Janata Dal (United), Bahujan Samaj Party, Biju Janata Dal, Telugu Desam Party, DMK etc. addressed the gathering and pledged their support in the struggle to keep our food and farming free from GM crops. Several also promised to oppose the BRAI Bill in the Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

	On the eve of Quit India Day, August 8, over 2,000 citizens from 20 states came together at Jantar Mantar, Delhi for a day-long protest and march demanding that GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) and multinational seed giant, Monsanto quit India. The delegation marched to Parliament also asking the government to withdraw the BRAI (Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India) bill 2013. An Indian flag made out of organic cotton, which does not come from Monsanto's patented cotton seed, was an important symbol of the event. This flag was later gifted to the Prime Minister's delegate, urging him to unfurl this non-Bt cotton flag on Independence Day.

	Patna April 12, 2012: Access to energy for irrigation and agricultural activities is an important issue for the rural Bihar. Looking at the poor irrigation facilities due to unavailability of electric supply and availability of abundant sunshine in the state, Greenpeace today installed and demonstrated a low-cost solar pumping system at  the native village Kalyan Bigha of Hon’ble CM of Bihar Shree Nitish Kumar. These low cost solar pumping systems offer a huge potential to increase the agricultural productivity of the state. 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Agriculture sector has critical role to play in overall development of state. In fact 81 %[i] of the state population is largely dependent on agriculture. This contributes 42%[ii] to the State Domestic product. The low cost solar PV pumping system will reduce the dependency on erratic power supply which results in poor irrigation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the recently announced agriculture roadmap, insurance of a truly pioneering "Rainbow Revolution" will remain an unfulfilled dream without the focus on proper irrigation system," says Arpana Udupa, Energy Campaigner of Greenpeace India. She further said -"It is quite apparent that a strong political will and an enabling framework with focus on low cost solar pump set will take Bihar towards inclusive growth. The state must work towards ensuring secure irrigation system to put Bihar on world map as champion of Rainbow Revolution. This can be achieved only through renewable energy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While welcoming the demonstration Awadhesh Kumar Verma, Mukhiya of Kalyan Bigha emphasized that such initiatives should be supported by government to save cost on expensive and polluting diesel. He said that "such technologies will make us self-sustaining with regards to water and electricity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar PV pumping system is light-weight and can be manually installed in any open well or bore well. It delivers 1500-2000 liters of water per hour for 6-8 hours on a sunny day. For better water management and maximum output, it is recommended that drip irrigation method should be used. The model fits well with Bihar State Micro-Irrigation Project (BSMIP) objective to encourage drip and sprinkler irrigation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While describing the benefit of such pump set, Col. Vivek Mundkur of Atom Solar said that "The innovative DC model directly runs on power produced by solar panels without the need for batteries, costs less than a lakh rupees and is more durable than any other irrigation pump set models currently in use. Without any operational costs, this model provides an alternative to irrigation pump sets which run on grid electricity and diesel. I believe it has huge operational potential in Bihar."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inauguration was attended by the Manish Kumar, Director BREDA, Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, District Magistrate Nalanda, Representatives of Bihar Renewable Energy Support Network, and Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project (BRLP) along with the residents of Kalyan Bigha.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h5&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 1px 10px 10px 1px; vertical-align: text-top; border: 1px solid black;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/54534_103068.jpg" alt="Brikesh's family"&gt;My caricature, my family and the artist Harish.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was one of the busiest day after 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of September when I climbed up this tree. Around 170 people from schools, colleges, NGO’s, came to visit me.Among them was an artist and with his students he made a few caricatures and paintings for Junglistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important visitors was my family (mom, dad, brother and sister-in-law). My mom was asked by the crowd about how she feels about her son living on a tree for a month. When she spoke she came out notches higher in inspiring the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 1px 10px 10px 1px; border: 1px solid black;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/54535_103066.jpg" alt="Frog" width="264" height="191"&gt;Day 17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the hustle bustle of the previous day, this day was fairly quite. Spotting small creatures is still a big deal for us. I don't know how we will react when we finally see something big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junglistan Nivas has become the latest 'hang-out' for the children from the near by village. The swing made under the tree house is a big draw for the local kinds who walk a minimum 2 kms to come and have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: text-bottom; margin: 1px 10px 10px 1px; border: 1px solid black;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/54539_103058.jpg" alt="Children have a good time"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 70 junior college students landed up in the morning to find out how coal mining is destroying the tiger habitat. We had a long discussion and where I explained what all coal mining can possibly destroy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time's moving really fast in the forests and October's almost here. &lt;a href="http://www.junglistan.org/act" target="_blank"&gt;Sign the petition&lt;/a&gt; if you haven't already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll leave you with a fun picture.This photo was taken by a 10 year old Rohit from Bhatadi village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin-right: 10px; margin-left: 1px; border: 1px solid black; vertical-align: text-top;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/54540_103056.jpg" alt="Children from the nearby village"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven Greenpeace activists today projected the message "Act for the climate! Go solar!" onto the hill of Wayna Picchu to mark the beginning of the end of coal- and oil-driven economies. As the UN climate summit begins in Lima, Greenpeace is asking decision-makers attending the 20th session of Conference of the Parties (COP 20) to adopt a new course and lead us to 100% renewable energy for all by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
“India stands at a very important and exciting juncture at this point of time as far as solar energy access is concerned. Almost immediately after assuming office, Prime Minister, Narendra Modi had set a commitment for his government to harness solar energy for providing basic energy access to every Indian by 2019. While there have been a slew of announcements related to renewable energy in last six months by Government, and the new ambition for renewable is indeed exciting, unfortunately the Indian economy is still heavily dependent on fossil-fuel based energy and there is as much interest in expanding coal power even at the cost of India’s largest contiguous tiger habitats,” says Abhishek Pratap, senior climate and energy campaigner, Greenpeace India.
Greenpeace Head of Climate Politics Martin Kaiser said: “The Temple of the Sun in Machu Picchu is where we are announcing to the world that, as the power of the sun is our past, it is also our future. We urge summit attendees to commit to the world’s largest source of energy — the sun — to solve our global climate crisis. The US and China’s recent announcement is a turning point and must spur a global commitment to the ambitious goal of 100% renewable energy for everyone. At COP 20, we call on major emitter countries in particular to table bold commitments for 2025. The whole world is watching – now is the time to act.” 
The climate summit convenes ministers from 194 countries to negotiate agreements on the legally blinding text that will become the protocol for COP 21 in Paris next year. It will provide an insight into what we may expect with regard to long-term phasing out of coal- fired power plants, renewable energy deployment and support for vulnerable least developed countries.
Currently, 1.2 billion of the global population suffers from lack of access to basic modern energy. One- third of this, that is, a whopping 300 million people live in India. “Ensuring sustainable and basic energy access and adequate development for these people is a major challenge that the world faces in this era of climate crisis. Rather than locking ourselves in a fossil-fuel driven path, we need to build an energy infrastructure that is climate friendly and provides energy security,” says Pratap.
“With 5.4 percent of global emissions, India is the world’s fourth largest carbon emitter, after China (22 percent), the US (13 percent) and EU27 (10 percent). Not only is India amongst the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, but the fossil fuel driven energy system is already throwing up local challenges of health from air pollution, water pollution and in many areas driving further water distress,” says Pratap.
Greenpeace India urges the Indian government to play a proactive role in not only ensuring the major polluters are held to account, but also that India recognises its vulnerability towards climate change. Greenpeace demands that the Indian government adopts a strategic approach to addressing the negotiations rather than stick to old and obsolete positions.

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 1.5px; border: 0.5px solid black;" title="Welcome to Junglistan" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/54/57254/30326_59533.jpg" alt="Sheroo and Bhaloo offer citizenship to Junglistan" width="291" height="433"&gt;Bear necessities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life  can be difficult for a bear, especially when you are in the city. You  might be wondering what am I doing  here and before you jump to any  conclusions, let me tell you my story.  Firstly and most importantly I am not one of the dancing bears that  you probably saw as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My  name is Bhaloo and I have come from the Republic of Junglistan. I come  from a Republic which is home to many other species including humans.  Everything was fine. Humans and animals were co-existing harmoniously, I  had enough honey to eat in the forest and for generations my fellow  humans have been collecting and selling Tendu leaves and Mahua  to feed their  families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  Republic where I come from does not discriminate against rich or poor,  animals or humans. For hundreds of years the Republic of Junglistan has  provided for rain, water, fruits, shelter, greenery, herbs, medicines  and even livelihood for humans without asking for anything but some  respect in return. But all we got was deceit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From forests to the City for a reason&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was living a very happy life in Junglistan and had no intention of coming to  the city. But then my  friend Monkey told me that humans are coming to destroy our home  because they want to extract something called 'Coal'. I have  heard there is tonnes of coal lying under our forest and it's of  some use to you humans. So you want to dig it all out, without even  thinking about what that would do to all of who have been  living here  for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If coal is underground then I am sure  Mother Nature has some reason for keeping it that way. Maybe it's  underground because if it does come out it will harm Mother  Nature. Why do you have to play with nature and spoil the party for so  many of us? We might not have the right to vote  in your Parliament but does not mean you have the right to kill us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I  thought, 'Enough is enough,' and convinced my friend Sheroo to pack his  bags and come to the city with me. We are here to save our home, the  Republic of Junglistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Junglistan!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheroo  and I are offering all humans free citizenship to the great Republic  of Junglistan. You don't have to fill forms, get a police  verification, or wait for weeks. You'll get an instant passport. All you have to do  is give a missed call to pledge your support to save our home -the forests. On behalf  of all the citizens of the Republic of Junglistan, Sheroo and I invite  you to come and visit Junglistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; margin: 1.5px; border: 0.5px solid black;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/54/57254/30327_59531.jpg" alt="become a citizen of Junglistan" width="397" height="235"&gt;We  will welcome you with open arms. Anyone with a smile on their face, love  in their heart and respect for us is eligible to become a citizen of Junglistan. People with  greed are not welcome. We fear those who, inspite of all the hospitality and love we offered, have always given us deciet and destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life in the city so far&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's  our seventh day in the city and we have gone to schools, market places,  travelled in autos, met hundreds of people who have already joined the  Republic of Junglistan and promised to stand by us for saving the  forests. This morning I tried to enter the Wankhede stadium in Mumbai to  cheer Sachin's hundred and gather more support but they didn't let me  in. They said, "Animals not allowed." I came out disappointed and stood  outside the stadium only to get further disappointed when Sachin missed  his hundred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachin's  100 will come soon but we will never come back if our  home is destroyed. We will be in your city for a while. All we ask for  is love and peace. So please &lt;strong&gt;give a missed call to 080-49311109&lt;/strong&gt; to or just click here to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.in/junglistan/save/take-the-pledge.php" target="_blank"&gt;become a citizen of Junglistan.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come one, come all, just give us a missed call!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

				&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The country wants energy, government and corporates want money. Does anyone 'need' forests?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coal mining companies are mining where ever they find it easy to mine coal. Their mining practices are highly inefficient because efficiency requires high investment; high investment affects 'the bottom line' - company profits. As they go mining the top layers of coal from allocated mines, they need to mine more and more land to power their furnaces and fill their pockets. And the corrupt government is not hard to "convince".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I care? A lot of the coal lies under dense forests that are hundreds or even thousands of years old. These forests are not just home to trees but to thousands of life forms, which will be lost when the forests are destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.junglistan.org/home"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 1px; border: 0.5px solid black;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/54/57254/53042_100250.jpg" alt="Save junglistan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; So when the coal companies eye the forests in Central India, they are also eyeing the homes of tribal communities, endangered species like tigers  and many other forms of life that support whole eco-systems. As a human being, I care for other living beings. If I don't support them now, I can't expect their support, when my way of life is threatened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern is not just the dying forests and living beings. Numerous experts have said that even if we mine all the coal that is available all through the country, we will still run out of coal in around 40 years. What then? We will import, they say. What about when the coal runs out there as well or becomes too expensive? The answer is: start planning now for other sources. Renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, India is hosting a Convention on Bio Diversity (CBD) in Hyderabad where world leaders will get together to talk about how to conserve bio-diversity by putting the right policies in place. We are asking the Prime Minister to come up with categorisation which will protect some of India's biodiverse and ecologically important forests from any future mining plans Additionally, we need to start planning for a future where we can switch most of our energy generation from coal to renewable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The forests are home to various other life forms. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The forests are a carbon sink in our increasingly polluted country. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coal destroys forests, livelihoods and then our health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coal is going to run out one day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government has already lost more than a few lakh crores of tax payer's money by not smartly allocating mines instead gifting them away. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Renewable energy can meet most of our electricity needs – many governments are already on the right path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time they stop thinking about making money and start thinking about a better future for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll stand up and express my 'need' for the forests to stay; do you care to &lt;a href="http://www.junglistan.org/act" target="_blank"&gt;JOIN me?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	05th June, New Delhi/Mumbai/ Bangalore : In the middle of the ongoing agricultural crisis devastating lives and fields across India, comes a story of incredible hope, from Kedia village in Jamui district of Bihar. On the occasion of World Environment Day, Greenpeace India launched its ‘Food for Life’ campaign, bringing the Kedia success story to urban consumers in three metros, in an effort to bridge the gap between farmers and urban consumers.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Food for Life campaign is based on a ‘Living Soils’ approach; an attempt to fix the broken agricultural system, reduce chemical dependency, and restore soil health by focussing on replenishing the nutrient value of the soil with biomass-based organic supplements.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The success of this eco-agricultural model village Kedia was brought to life at the World Environment Day event through a film screening and a street play, followed by a panel discussion allowing the urban audience to thoroughly investigate this alternative way of farming. Following the Living Soils approach, farmers in Kedia have combined innovative science, traditional knowledge, and farmers’ own experiential wisdom to restore their soil and community health, and brought relative prosperity to the community by reducing their dependence on market-bought, chemical-based inputs while enjoying healthier yields.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The ‘Green Revolution’ left behind a broken agricultural system, with farmers being forced to accept ever-new ways to exploit natural resources, not working in harmony with nature as they had traditionally done,” said Greenpeace campaigner Ishteyaque Ahmed, speaking at the event today. “Since 2014, when we first started facilitating this change In Kedia, we have witnessed the beautiful result of nature, farmer and the government machinery collaborating and coordinating with mutual respect. We are also seeing a renewed focus on farming naturally, increasing awareness of biodiversity and biofuels.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Essentially, through this project, we are bringing consumers in touch with those who produce their food, and encouraging greater cooperation in the path to progress. We are also promoting a largely self-sufficient model of sustainable livelihoods, which by eliminating the middlemen, is creating greater opportunities for the farming community to profit from their own efforts,” Ahmed continued.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Also speaking at the event, renowned seed saver and close associate of Vividhara and the Beej Bachao Andolan, Ajay Mahajan said, “For organic farming to succeed, there is a fundamental need for the food production system to be managed better by farmers and consumers. At present, there is scarcely any collaboration between farmers and consumers, and a direct, negative result of this dissonance is being felt on the soil, the fields, and on food security.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rajkumar Yadav, one of the farmers from Kedia, also sent a message to audiences at the event today, “By making our own fertilisers and pest control medicines with organic, natural ingredients already available to us, we have been able to significantly reduce the input costs of our farming, but perhaps more importantly, we can rest secure in the knowledge that we – and you – are safe from the ill effects of the chemicals that would otherwise be used.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more information, please contact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anindita Datta Choudhury: +91 9871515804; &lt;img class="obfimg Eoi_1" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Templates/Planet3/Styles/Images/emailimages/cd2de372d663f95e4e68ccb194bfac54.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

	&lt;p&gt;The Bihar state government has devised a tax incentives plan to encourage private players to invest in solar energy. This move is especially significant since the state has been reeling under massive power shortage. The tax benefits include an exemption of registration and entry tax on installation of solar power plants on wastelands in the state.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Chief Minister of Bihar has even installed solar panels at his official residence in a bid to create more awareness of the potential of this renewable resource. After conducting a survey which proved the immense potential of solar power generation in the state, the government has sent proposals to the state cabinet for approval to generate 250 MW through various solar power projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Institute of Sustainable Energy (WISE) found that Bihar receives 280 days of sunshine in a year and falls in the moderate solar radiation zone of the country. This means the state is perfectly positioned to generate a lot of solar energy to satisfy its power needs. The tax incentives help smaller players to also enter the market and this move should see a rise in solar power production in the state. Now the real question is will other states in the country follow suit and provide attractive subsidies to encourage more investment in renewable energy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WMO Bulletin warns that greenhouse gas concentrations reach highest level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations World Meteorological Organization (WMO) released their annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin in November and it revealed that the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere reached a record high in 2011. [2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary greenhouse gas, carbon di oxide, also the main cause of global warming reached a level of 390.9 parts per million in 2011. This is 140 % of the pre-industrial levels and nearly two parts per million higher than the 2010 carbon dioxide levels. The burning of fossil fuels is the main source of carbon di oxide in the atmosphere. The other greenhouse gases are methane and nitrous oxide which reached a new high of about 1813 parts per billion (ppb) and 324.2 parts per billion respectively in 2011. Increasing concentrations of all these gases in the atmosphere are the causes of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud said, “These billions of tonnes of additional carbon dioxide in our atmosphere will remain there for centuries, causing our planet to warm further and impacting all aspects of life on earth. Future emissions will only compound the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;

<item><subtitle>One-third of Delhi’s current power demand can be met by using just 1.6 % of Delhi’s roofspace. Solar champions felicitated at RE Champions Conclave.</subtitle><tags>renewables</tags><text>&lt;h2&gt;One-third of Delhi’s current power demand can be met by using just 1.6 % of Delhi’s roofspace. Solar champions felicitated at RE Champions Conclave.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	23 April 2013, New Delhi: Greenpeace India, today released its compelling report “Rooftop Revolution: Unleashing Delhi’s Solar Potential” disclosing Delhi’s potential for solar power at 2 gig watts (GW) using only 1.6 per cent of the city’s roofspace1. The report, released by former Chief Justice of India, A P Shah, charts a green and viable path for Delhi to move towards energy security.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Co-authored with Bridge to India, the report reveals that by achieving the 2 GW potential the city can generate 4500 million kilowatt hours of solar power every year, meeting 16 per cent of its electricity needs. This can bridge the ever increasing gap between demand and supply of energy. It can also insure us against the dirty, unsustainable, uncertain and costly electricity from conventional sources like coal and diesel.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rooftop revolution is not just a report but a vision to realise Delhi as a green capital powered by clean and sustainable sources of energy like solar. This report comes at a time when the national capital is facing serious electricity crisis and rising tariffs. This report provides an alternative pathway. What is required is political intent to convert this vision into a reality,” said Anand Prabhu Pathanjali, energy campaigner, Greenpeace India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest potential for solar power rests with residential buildings at 1.2 GW or 49 % of the total solar potential, followed by industrial buildings at 15 %, government buildings and public facilities at 13 %. The report not only maps the potential and viability of the various building types falling under different tariff categories but also details business models and scenarios under which solar rooftop is advantageous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For residences, solar rooftop is still very complex and needs some fiscal support. However, the increasing power tariffs from grid electricity and the falling prices of solar systems make it a potential and sustainable source of energy. In 2012 alone, power tariffs in Delhi increased by about 20 per cent and are expected to rise by 25 per cent in the next five years. On the other hand, solar prices have fallen by almost 50 per cent in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significantly, government buildings, due to their proximity to each other and large roof space, facilitate bundling of projects that can enable large project sizes to the tune of 2000 kilowatt power. Large solar systems reduce the per kilowatt cost considerably making solar already viable for government buildings.  Hence, there is clear viability for solar power in Delhi without long term capital subsidy as the scenarios in the report illustrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “Solar power is now not about if but about when. It is inevitable as the energy system of the future. What was lacking was the insight into the potential that the city holds. This report fills that gap and is an exhaustive document that outlines the new energy structure for Delhi. This report provides arguments and data to the Delhi government, distribution companies, and its people to show why solar makes sense for the city,” said Dr Tobias Engelmeier, managing director, Bridge to India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report was released at the Renewable Energy Champions Conclave. Former Chief Justice of Delhi High Court, Justice A. P. Shah and former Union Power Minister Suresh Prabhu felicitated Resident Welfare Associations (RWA), institutions and civil society for being the first to pledge their rooftop’s for solar power and supporting a strong solar rooftop policy for Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the renewable champions felicitated were hotel Le Meridien, Indira Gandhi National Open University, Tamil Nadu Bhawan, Holy Family Hospital, URJA group of RWAs and one Bhagidari RWA. Greenpeace has been running a campaign “Switch on the Sun” to promote renewable energy as a sustainable and viable solution to Delhi’s power crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “A city which aspires to be a world class city needs to secure its energy through clean energy sources. Solar rooftop offers a locally available energy generation choice. Implementing this roadmap can ensure that the second richest state of the country becomes a progressive city at the forefront of a modern energy system,” added Pathanjali.&lt;/p&gt;

	Cities of Uttar Pradesh are none-too-better-off than Delhi when it comes to alarming levels of air pollution from Ghaziabad to Varanasi

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Delhi 16th November 2017&lt;/strong&gt;| While Delhi has been in the headlines for one of the worst air pollution crisis in its history, Uttar Pradesh, the densely populated State of India bordering Delhi, is also witnessing hazardous air pollution levels. Prominent cities such as Varanasi, Lucknow, Kanpur, Allahabad, Noida, Ghaziabad, Agra and Moradabad are constantly witnessing high PM2.5 concentration. According to the Central Pollution Control Board data, the air quality in these cities has reached way beyond “severe” category.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The PM2.5 levels across Uttar Pradesh on 13th November 2017 were 556 in Moradabad, 541 in Ghaziabad, 474 in Kanpur, 445 in Lucknow, 323 in Noida, 214 in Agra, and 201 in Varanasi. Overall the air quality in these cities is no less polluted than Delhi which noticed PM2.5 levels at 359 µg/m3 on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Hazardous pollution levels are not just restricted to Delhi. Entire north India is grappling with a virtual public health emergency. The problem is quite severe. And yet we are looking at Delhi’s pollution scenario alone by turning a blind eye to health of people living across other regions exposed to equally hazardous pollution levels. Uttar Pradesh is a classic case of this. There are other cities in the Indo-Gangetic plains spanning right from Punjab going all the way to UP and Bihar that are just as polluted as Delhi.  This clearly depicts that air pollution is a regional issue and solution to this lies in acting in a coordinated and systematic way across regions rather than limiting it to a few city centers such as Delhi,” said Sunil Dahiya, Campaigner, Greenpeace India.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The central pollution control board data shows that since October none of the cities across Uttar Pradesh had met the national air quality standards. Analysing the scenario further, &lt;em&gt;Dahiya said, “The callous responses and myopic tactic is causing apocalyptic situation in entire north India, There is an urgent need to tackle multiple sources of pollution through time bound, systematic and comprehensive action plan at various geographic level and time scale, most immediate being regional action plan for the State.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the WHO report, world’s four most polluted cities are in Uttar Pradesh. And these are Allahabad, Kanpur, Firozabad and Lucknow. Uttar Pradesh has a high concentration of industrial and agricultural activities along with a badly managed growth of the transport sector. UP has around &lt;strong&gt;10%&lt;/strong&gt; of India’s operating coal fired power generation capacity installed across the State. Greenpeace India’s “&lt;a title="out of sight" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/cleanairnation/Reports/Out%20of%20Sight.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Out of Sight&lt;/a&gt;” report released last year highlighted that the current installed capacity of thermal power generation is causing a "steady deterioration" in the overall air quality in North India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The impact of air pollution on human health has been studied extensively. We have passed the stage of merely debating about air pollution, short term measures such as graded response action plan similar to Delhi should also be implemented in other northern cities across Uttar Pradesh.  Rather than debating whether it is yet an emergency situation or not government is trivialising the issue. Instead of that it should implement strict, time-bound action plan to address various sources of air pollution across India. We need an ambitious and systematic national clean air action plan with focused and precise targets, clear timelines and demonstrable accountability towards public health.  It's high time to realise that states need to bring regional action plan and demand for a national policy to combat air pollution. This should address the root causes of the problem,”&lt;/em&gt; concludes Dahiya.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For further details please contact-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Innovation Challenge 2013
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Innovation Challenge was launched on 3rd September, and ended on 15th November. The challenge was different - it invited submissions from all over the world to do something unique, something that could transform the way our agricultural sector functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what did we crack at the end of the challenge? We got three designs for a solar water pump which will be prototyped in the farms of Bihar next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did we need it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water pumps in Bihar farmlands are mainly run on diesel. A fuel that increases the cost of crops significantly as the prices rise very frequently. In a financial squeeze, farmers are forced to abandon their land and move to city slums to look for other work. Meanwhile, diesel engine emissions accelerate global warming, and extreme climate events like super floods and mega droughts further threaten farmers' fragile livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did we ask for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renewable technology in water pumping is fairly untapped. There are solar pumps available in the market, but none which meet the economic and social criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did we get?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three amazing designs from different parts of the world! The Innovation Challenge got over 1,500 participants from 58 countries and our total number of submissions was over 200!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winners are in Patna, Bihar today. They are super excited about their design making it to the farms of Bihar. Here's what they had to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner, Eric Jensen (Canada)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I am very happy to have participated in the challenge. I wanted to create a design which can be easily constructed and assembled. The open style of challenge was very helpful. Comments and feedback from participants, jury and others helped my design become what it is. I look forward to seeing a prototype of this solar pump in Bihar."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st runner up, Vivek (India)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When the challenge started 3 months ago, we had the basic challenge of the pump working on 1 horse power. We started improving the design as the time went by. We finally came up with a design which is reliable, accessible and available in the market."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenpeace: How did you find the open style innovation challenge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The open challenge was indeed a fresh way of approaching competitions and challenges. We were keenly observing the comments, ratings and many thousand views on my profile constantly. The comments and feedback helped me a lot to evolve my design from what it was originally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally believe this product is going to have a social impact more than anything else I have seen, because it enables a farmer to grow 2 or 3 crops in a year – instead of one crop that they are used to. Without using diesel pumps he is going to be saving a lot of money, which will enable him to break the poverty cycle, hence leading to a better lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several farmers end up in the city to search for employment leaving their family behind. If their agricultural fields make enough profits then secondary effects will kick in – for example, migration to urban cities will be controlled. Also because it's a 1 horse power pump, it makes it affordable to the small marginal farmer and will enable him to pay back the loan of 1 lakh in a year, and break free from the debt cycle."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd runner up: Balázs Gábor Nagy (Hungary)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A friend of mine told me about the challenge. I am primarily interested in renewable energy technology. I do not work in this domain, I am an engineer working in TV production, but working on renewable technology is my hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the challenge very interesting. I did the research on my own, for example, I called the solar pump manufacturers in India, China, Italy – to understand how to design a pump. I had prior knowledge of the technology before but needed some more insight to come with a new design. It was fairly a straightforward challenge. You have a panel, pump, I had to match them together."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenpeace: How did you find the open style innovation challenge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was interesting, I used the information, mainly the feedback – my final design was quite different from the inception of the first idea. I used the platform to connect with Vivek and Jensen after the final submission of my design. I am not the kind of person thinking about the money, it is important that these farmers will get a usable product. I am not thinking of commercializing the product myself. I would be happy if someone uses my idea. I used this challenge as a learning process."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	Damning information obtained by Greenpeace India through online reports and Right to Information applications from State Pollution Control Boards across India, shows that none of the Indian cities comply with standards prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO)

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;New Delhi | January 11, 2017 |&lt;/strong&gt; Damning information obtained by Greenpeace India through online reports and Right to Information applications from State Pollution Control Boards across India, shows that none of the Indian cities comply with standards prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and very few cities in southern India comply to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) standards. The information was revealed in a report titled ‘&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2j6A87e"&gt;Airpocalypse’&lt;/a&gt; [1] that assesses air quality in 168 cities across 24 states and  union territories and pinpoints fossil fuels as one of the main culprits for the deteriorating air quality across the country.
“Air pollution is a national public health crisis as almost none of the cities have bothered to keep air pollution in check, making them unlivable. We are facing an apocalypse right now due to unbreathable air, Deaths due to air pollution are only a fraction less than those due to use of tobacco yet  authorities are laying a deaf ear to the numerous scientific reports that have set alarm bells ringing.,” says Sunil Dahiya, campaigner, Greenpeace India.   
The top 20 most polluted cities have &lt;a href="http://www.unep.org/tnt-unep/toolkit/pollutants/facts.html"&gt;PM 10 [2]&lt;/a&gt; levels between 268 µg/m3and 168 µg/m3 for the year 2015. While, Delhi tops the list with 268 µg/m3, it is followed closely by Ghaziabad, Allahabad, and Bareli in Uttar Pradesh; Faridabad in Haryana; Jharia in Jharkhand, Alwar in Rajasthan; Ranchi, Kusunda and Bastacola in Jharkhand; Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, and Patna In Bihar; with PM10 levels ranging from 258 µg/m3to 200 µg/m3.
Fossil fuels are the culprit
The report also mentions the sources of pollution in several cities based on review of earlier research available. The most polluted cities are spread across the North India, starting from Rajasthan and then moving along the Indo-gangetic belt to West Bengal. A closer analysis of the data obtained through RTI and previous studies on air pollution pin-point to continued use of fossil fuels as the main culprit for the dangerous rise in the level of pollutants in the air across the country
Further explaining the report which was aimed at highlighting the fact that air pollution needs to be addressed as a national problem, Dahiya says: “India’s pollution trends have been steadily increasing, with &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Press/India-overtakes-China-in-number-of-deaths-due-to-outdoor-air-pollution-in-2015/"&gt;India overtaking China in number of deaths due to outdoor air pollution in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. India’s deteriorating air quality demands an urgent robust monitoring system.”
Last month, the Supreme Court approved the ‘&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Press/Supreme-Court-Accord-to-Graded-response-system-to-tackle-air-pollution-a-welcome-move-Greenpeace/"&gt;graded response system&lt;/a&gt;’ to tackle air pollution in Delhi. Greenpeace India welcomes the move, but maintains that the system needs to be implemented across the country, coupled with robust monitoring systems in place so that people can have access to real time data on the level of pollutants in the air. “This report clearly shows that air pollution is not restricted to Delhi. Thus, our pollution reduction strategies needs to be much more ambitious, systematic and with focused targets with clear timelines. Accountability and compliance mechanism should be in place, with no leniency towards the fossil fuel dependant sectors such as, power and transport.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

	New Delhi, 22 November 2011: Seeking people’s support to stop destruction of forests for coal mining, Greenpeace today launched the imaginary Republic of Junglistan from its embassy at Jantar Mantar. Bhaalu and Sheru, the endangered and threatened residents of Junglistan, handed out virtual citizenships and passports to people who pledged their support for the fast depleting forests and diversity.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;India is witnessing an unprecedented boom in coal mining and establishment of new coal-fired thermal power plants. A significant proportion of the planned power plants, and virtually all of the new coal mines, are located in a region broadly referred to as central India – covering the states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and parts of Orissa and eastern Maharashtra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, about 26,000 hectares of forest land has been diverted for coal mining alone since 2007 making it one of the biggest threats to forests in the country. Forests are not only habitat for the wild and the people dependent on them but also provide essential services to cities by being sources to their water resources and lungs for the cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Coal India Limited already has 200,000 hectares of land with them of which 55,000 hectares is forest land. Hence their contention that forest clearances are hampering power generation is misleading. The ministry’s insistence on more land for mining is nothing short of land grab, which is also endangering our forests, our tigers, elephants and bears, biodiversity and the fabric of life of forest communities. We are inviting people to join Junglistan as a show of support to our forests,” said Usha Saxena, public engagement campaigner, Greenpeace India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are alternate sources of energy that are cleaner and sustainable and India will have to make that choice if it wants energy security as well as a safe environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This nationwide mobilisation drive will register people’s support across cities on ground and online. &lt;span&gt;The campaign is being launched in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai simultaneously and will reach Bangalore and Chandrapur next week. The mascots of Junglistan, Sheru and Bhaalu, will be touring Delhi to gather support and members for Junglistan and spread awareness about the threat to their habitat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first passport was presented to the first citizen of the country, President Shrimati Pratibha Devi Singh Patil, by children on Children’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;

	New Delhi, 26th August 2015: Greenpeace is urging the Delhi Government to capitalise on Delhi’s rooftop solar potential, and make an immediate start towards implementing the draft Solar Policy presented on Tuesday.  
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;" align="center"&gt;&lt;span style="text-align: left;" lang="EN-US"&gt; The draft solar policy was presented at the Delhi Solar Roundtable Conference organized by the Delhi Dialogue Commission (DDC), a think tank of the Delhi Government attended by a broad range of stakeholders including DISCOMs, developers, government officials, Delhi’s Electricity Regulatory Commission, consulting organizations, banks, solar energy experts from Germany, and non-governmental organisations including Greenpeace India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;“In 2013, the Greenpeace report &lt;em&gt;Rooftop Revolution: Unleashing Delhi’s Solar Potential &lt;/em&gt;[i] showed that Delhi could be a 2GW Solar City by 2020. The political instability of intervening years has already caused multiple delays in implementing solutions that would progress us towards this ambitious but achievable target. We now hope the Delhi government will show strong commitment towards the timeline presented in the draft policy, and that we actually see Delhi harness 1GW of solar power by 2020 and 2GW by 2025 in a phased manner,” said Pujarini Sen, Climate and Energy Campaigner, Greenpeace India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;The roundtable and the draft policy mark a critical first step towards realising one of the promises made in the Aam Aadmi Party’s 70 point election manifesto. The Delhi Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal briefly attended the roundtable and reinforced his government’s commitment to transition towards clean energy. Though the CM stressed his concerns about the possibility of rapid expansion of solar power in other segments leading to an increase in tariffs in the residential segment, there are concrete solutions that could protect Delhi residents from the burden of additional costs, as experts at the Roundtable pointed out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Several noteworthy details in the draft policy will, if implemented, benefit consumers in &lt;a name="14f6995847a9d23a__GoBack"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;residential and other segments. Though solar tariffs at the lower end of the residential sector are yet to reach parity with conventional energy tariffs, the ‘Generation Based Incentive’ for Rs.2 per solar unit for three years will encourage early adopters. The draft particularly places its initial emphasis on government, industrial and commercial sectors. Given current tariff structures, and with the Consolidated Net Metering proposed, these sectors can see significant savings even without any subsidies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; “Delhi has immense rooftop potential, and given current market conditions, it offers the perfect opportunity to demonstrate the viability of a decentralized renewable energy pathway. The experience at Holy Family Hospital, our partner during the ‘Switch on the Sun’ campaign was discussed as a case study at the roundtable. Their solar rooftop installation, which can also be implemented by government buildings, has already enabled them to slash their energy bill considerably. Greenpeace has learned from the hospital that they save over 15 lakh rupees per year on their energy bill,” added Sen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Greenpeace India has been campaigning for greater national investment in solar energy; it’s 2013 report &lt;em&gt;Powering Ahead with Renewables: Leaders and Laggards &lt;/em&gt;[ii] provided a national ranking on RPO performance, and showed up Delhi as one of the worst performers with less than 1% of renewable in their energy mix. The proposed mandate of achieving 75% renewable purchase obligation (RPO) from within the state and penalties for non-compliance are progressive recommendations put forth in the draft policy, given Delhi’s RPO performance in past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Talking about the draft policy, the Vice Chairperson of DDC, Ashish Khetan, said, “We want to make Delhi a leading solar city of the world, and provide clean, affordable power to the people. Our focus is to bring a policy that’s in sync with the overall energy priorities of Delhi.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;“Greenpeace has shown how solar power can help the AAP government deliver on not one, but two of its election promises: &lt;em&gt;Sustainable Street Lighting: Delhi&lt;/em&gt;[iii] a Greenpeace report handed over to the Delhi Dialogue Commission earlier this year, lays out a plan to light up dark spots in the capital through solar energy. We have had multiple meetings with DDC on the same, and if implemented, solar street lights can literally light the way towards a sustainable vision for Delhi’s future,” concluded Sen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: text-top; margin: 4px 1px; border: 1px solid black;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/54540_103056.jpg" alt="Brikesh Singh in the forest"&gt;I had been excited for days for two reasons: TEDx was being hosted in Coimbatore and Greenpeace activist, Brikesh Singh agreed to be a speaker at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stage was set and the speakers were getting ready. I was waiting with bated breath for Brikesh to get on stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was time for Brikesh's talk, all we could hear was the sound of a lizard sucking in its prey but there was no Brikesh in sight! Shortly after, he stepped up on stage and began his talk entitled 'Junglistan Diaries'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire idea of spending a month on a tree around the edge of Tadoba forest reserve in Chandrapur originated when Greenpeace India began to highlight the dangers of coal mining in India's forests in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 1px 10px; border: 1px solid black;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/80266_129130.jpg" alt="Brikesh at Tedx" width="283" height="373"&gt;Brikesh spoke about the tree house and how it became his home for over a month. He spoke about the 'fish pedicures' he got for free every day. He said, "Nothing goes waste in the forest. The food chain is well kept, under no supervision."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had made friends with a bunch of children who would come to play in the forest next to his tree house. One of the children had cooked him "bamboo ki bhajji" using bamboos from the forest. There also came a day when a leopard took halt on a tree near Brikesh's tree house. He was quite sure that the animal would have sensed his presence but neither seemed to fear the other. They existed all together, the way it's supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of his stay, an elderly man had travelled to the Tadoba reserve just to show his support for Greenpeace India and its cause. Brikesh said that he was more optimistic and positive towards his cause, once he knew there was public backing him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was watching a young environmentalist, his head held high and eyes filled with the love for nature. It was a pleasure to listen to him. I could almost experience being in the forest- its sights and sounds, as the slides went on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I had read about "Junglistan", signed petitions, shared it, got some friends on board too but it was just overwhelming to listen to the whole experience from the "Junglistani" himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vidhya is pursuing B.E. Environmental Engineering from Coimbatore. She has co founded the Environmental Care Group in her college and has been a cyberactivist with Greenpeace for the past four years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	New Delhi 20th March 2018| On Tuesday, environmental activists from different social background held a protest outside Badarpur power plant which has been shut down multiple times due to pollution issue and has become symbol of fight against air pollution. The protest was for reminding the MoEF&amp;CC for an immediate enforcement of the National Clean Air Program by making it public and putting sector wise plan to achieve 35% emission reduction in three years in public domain.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The activists urged to “Break free from Coal, Clean Air Now” highlighting stationary sources like power plants which are one of the largest and easiest source to tackle provided there is a will. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, in the financial capital, Mumbai, a group of  climbers also environmental enthusiasts have pinned a huge banner to the Vashi Bridge demanding “Mumbai Clean Air Now!”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ritesh Dwivedi, Activist said “&lt;em&gt;We have allowed ourselves enough to become the victim of air pollution, something that is easily mitigated by taking concrete and right steps. We are here because we had enough and now we need to see change. That change is only possible if government's actions towards solving the issue is discussed on public platforms first so that we know where are we heading. We are standing here for solidarity to millions like us suffering of an unseen monster called air pollution&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace India &lt;a title="Report" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2018/Airpocalypse_II_29Jan18.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Airpocalypse II&lt;/a&gt; report highlighted that more than 80% of cities in the country where air quality is monitored are severely polluted and it impacts 47 million children across the country. Also, 580 millions people in India don't even have a single air quality monitoring stations in districts they are living. &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fact that NCAP is not even available in the public domain raises concerns on how the government is going to make the NCAP a truly participatory initiative.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Further talking about the twin cities silent protests Sunil Dahiya, Senior Campaigner, Greenpeace India said “we want to send a strong message that people of this country are determined to fight against air pollution and reclaim their Right to Life, we cannot allow the interests of polluting power companies take our life and health for a ride. The fact that the current NCAP has hardly any mention on how big polluters should reduce their emissions shows that the government is still not serious about pig polluters like coal fired power plants. The government should make NCAP immediate available to public and have clear targets for reducing pollution from big polluters like power plants and industries.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Link to photographs: (Delhi &amp;amp; Mumbai) http://media.greenpeace.org/collection/27MZIFJXMY6VY &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For further details-&lt;br&gt;Avinash Kumar; Senior Communication Specialist;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace India; &lt;img class="obfimg Eoi_1" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Templates/Planet3/Styles/Images/emailimages/7934593b2dee1cb4fbaf9c73797ac2e9.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

	&lt;span&gt;Amid all the bad news on air quality, there is a ray of hope. After two years of incessant public demand for a comprehensive national action plan to tackle air pollution, the government has finally stated in the parliament that they have formulated a national clean air programme to tackle air pollution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img title="there is hope" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/133600_236597.jpg" alt="there is hope"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reply to Shrimati Renuka Chowdhury, Hon''ble Member of Parliament regarding ‘Long time policy to tackle the increasing air pollution’, the environment minister has called the following as MoEFCC's committment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The government has formulated  the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) as a long term time bound national level strategy, to tackle the increasing air pollution problem across the country in a comprehensive manner. The overall objective is to augment and evolve effective ambient air quality monitoring network across the country besides ensuring comprehensive management plan for prevention, control and abatement of air pollution. The NCAP focuses on collaborative and participatory approach comprising all sources of pollution and coordination between relevant Central Ministries, State Governments, local bodies and other stakeholders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img title="National clean air Programme" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/124948_215428.jpg" alt="National Clean air Programme"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
If the programme calls for a time bound plan to reduce different pollutants by X percent within a reasonable time, then a comprehensive strategy to tackle all sources of pollution is vital. What is also imperative is the need for an effective air quality monitoring network system that can assist in monitoring the progress of the action plan and provide people with real time data. The resultant of this should call for a  collaboration between the states to create a regional level corporation.  If all this reflects in the plan that they have formulated, then MoEFCC must be praised for a job well done.
&lt;span&gt;Obviously the proof of the pudding is in the eating. A good policy is only the first step. Everything depends on how well the policy is implemented. As citizens of the country we need to hold the government accountable while also doing our bits towards being responsible citizens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nandikesh Sivalingam&lt;/strong&gt; is the Climate and Energy Campaigns' Manager at Greenpeace India&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Solar energy represents a vital opportunity to power India cleanly and efficiently. So, along with &lt;a href="http://shikhamalaviya.com/"&gt;acclaimed young poet Shikha Malaviya&lt;/a&gt;, and in association with &lt;a href="http://www.delhipoetryslam.com/"&gt;Delhi Poetry Slam&lt;/a&gt;, we decided to spread the message about solar in a new way by asking Greenpeace supporters to help create a crowdsourced solar poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, poetry has been used as a tool for change, and to speak up for what we believe in. We believe that it’s up to us to write our future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Solar panels in solar village Dharnai" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/121530_207419.jpg" alt="Solar panels in solar village Dharnai"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules were simple. Shikha got the ball rolling with the first line of the poem, and threw it over to our supporters via social media to suggest the next lines. The direction of the poem was open. We simply asked that contributions related to the Sun in some way - whether directly to solar energy, or to how the Sun had touched people’s lives.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got a brilliant response, with many many people taking the time to share their hopes, fears and perspectives. It was then back to poet Shikha to craft the final poem using a mixture of supporters’ words and her own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, with poetry educator Nicole Sumner, Greenpeace volunteers came together to take part in a workshop on International Volunteer Day called Speak Your Peace in Delhi. Participants learned techniques for communicating impactful social messages using spoken word, with a focus on solar energy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the final poem, we hope you like it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Touched by the Sun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin each day touched by a star&lt;br&gt;Or do we end each night that way&lt;br&gt;Warm rays that strengthen from afar&lt;br&gt;light of which we are all made&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or do we end each night that way&lt;br&gt;bathed in hope of the rising sun&lt;br&gt;light of which we are all made&lt;br&gt;the star that makes us what we are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bathed in hope of the rising sun&lt;br&gt;prayers sown in fields of wheat&lt;br&gt;the star that makes us what we are&lt;br&gt;dancing over a billion hopes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayers sown in fields of wheat&lt;br&gt;entering slant from the East&lt;br&gt;dancing over a billion hopes&lt;br&gt;rousing koel birds from sleep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering slant from the East&lt;br&gt;Sol, Surya, Helios&lt;br&gt;rousing koel birds from sleep&lt;br&gt;we pay our gratitudes with a namaskar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sol, Surya, Helios&lt;br&gt;life force in every pore&lt;br&gt;we pay our gratitudes with a namaskar&lt;br&gt;wrapped in the silk of its heat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life force in every pore&lt;br&gt;powering our solar dreams&lt;br&gt;wrapped in the silk of its heat&lt;br&gt;no longer captives of the dark&lt;/p&gt;

<item><subtitle>Rooftop Solar can save Delhi from electricity tariff hikes  </subtitle><tags>renewables</tags><text>&lt;h2&gt;Rooftop Solar can save Delhi from electricity tariff hikes  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	February 4, New Delhi: With the Delhi government facing existential threat over the power crisis in the state, Greenpeace India on Monday wrote a letter to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal urging him to ask the DERC to roll-back tariff hike and accelerate the work on his government’s solar vision to cushion Delhi’s aam aadmi from increasing power costs. 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Doling out subsidies has already back-fired. Many areas in Delhi are as a result reporting long outages. Though the DERC, under pressure from power discoms, has hiked tariff rates even before the CAG’s audit results are out, Delhi government’s threat to cancel discoms’ licenses is foolhardy. Delhi chief minister must act smart and promptly announce policy measures to fulfill his manifesto target of meeting 20% of Delhi’s power needs by solar,” said Abhishek Pratap, Senior Campaigner, Greenpeace India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Irrespective of what the CAG audit reveals, there will be no end to tariff hikes and power cuts unless generation and distribution of electricity is diversified and Delhi is made self-reliant via rooftop solar,” he added. Jolted by DERC’s tariff hike of 6-8%, Delhiites are now staring at a blackout as the central power supplier NTPC has relented to extend only a 10-day deadline to the defaulting discoms, BSES Rajdhani and BSES Yamuna, to pay their dues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As per the hiked tariff rate announced last week, an average household in Delhi will now pay an extra of 8% on the overall bill. An average solar rooftop installation size of 2kW-3kW will generate 350-650 units a month, earning or saving the household Rs. 3,000 approximately. Thus, it can lead to direct 30% savings depending on the usage, besides insuring the household against power cuts and incessant threats posed by discoms,” explains Pratap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aam Aadmi Party in its manifesto for Delhi elections had promised incentives and subsidies to promote solar energy; and set a target of meeting 20% of Delhi’s electricity needs via solar energy by 2022&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Greenpeace had written a similar letter to the Delhi government on January 3 asking him to start work on his poll promise of solar energy. “We are still waiting for their response. It is unfortunate to find that the new government has still not prioritized this to find a solution to the energy crisis in the national capital,” added Pratap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Notes to the Editor: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="1"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   3. Comparison of Delhi’s electricity scenario and tariff hike vis-à-vis solar energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we analyze the recent trend in electricity tariff in Delhi and the national average benchmark for solar power cost per unit (as shown below), it is absolutely clear that it’s time for solar to shine on the roofs of Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;

	February 4, New Delhi: With the Delhi government facing existential threat over the power crisis in the state, Greenpeace India on Monday wrote a letter to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal urging him to ask the DERC to roll-back tariff hike and accelerate the work on his government’s solar vision to cushion Delhi’s aam aadmi from increasing power costs.

	&lt;span&gt;The present-day system of producing and consuming energy is problematic. As our populations continue to rise, the demand for energy-intensive lifestyles is also increasing. Since we need energy for a thriving economy, but don't produce enough from clean sources, our societies are at risk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Globally, fossil fuel burning is the biggest source of air pollution. In India, coal use almost doubled, and oil use grew by two-thirds in the last 10 years. Even as fossil fuel use becomes increasingly dominant, they will require more attention to tackle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Greenpeace India's new report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.gp/2EEDolH" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Airpocalypse II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; reveals that &lt;strong&gt;almost half of the Indian population (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;550 million) are living in areas that do not meet India's national air quality standards - standards which are by no means high.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; And another half (580 million) of the population live in areas for which there is no data about pollution levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img title="A thermal power plant in Germany" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/141315_255290.jpg" alt="A thermal power plant in Germany"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;Lessons from Germany&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Germany has managed to reduce air pollution levels quite significantly while maintaining high levels of coal and oil consumption by relying on ‘end-of-pipe’ technology. However, air pollution from coal-fired power plants and transport continues to cause &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://env-health.org/policies/climate-and-energy/europe-s-dark-cloud/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/policy_report/2014/Transport4Health/IHME_Transport4Health_Annex.pdf"&gt;&lt;span&gt;7400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; premature deaths in Germany every year, despite pollution control technologies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A note of caution when applying lessons from other countries:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Even if India had clean air standards like that of Germany, India would continue to suffer from very serious air pollution simply because of the large population density (total number of people per sq. km.). In order to maintain high living standards and clean air, India will need to pull up more effective solutions than those used by many smaller countries to improve air quality.
&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img title="Chinese Air pollution scene" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/141314_255288.jpg" alt="Chinese Air pollution scene"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons from China&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;span&gt;China is in a similar situation: they have a large population and a high concentration of heavy industry. Even if all the power plants, factories, vehicles and other emission sources met the most advanced emissions standards, onethird of China's cities - including Beijing - would fail to meet national air quality requirements. Shifting to cleaner energy sources and a cleaner economic structure is a necessary part of the solution. This is also something the Chinese government is aware of. The country's highly impactful National Air Pollution Action Plan included reductions in coal consumption, restrictions on new coal-burning plants and accelerated clean energy targets as a part of the measures to be taken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Levels of toxic particles (PM2.5) fell by 20% across eastern China during the target period of the action plan, from 2013 to 2017, resulting in an estimated 160,000 avoided deaths in 2017 alone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What works?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;span&gt;A study by the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;looked at the most cost-effective ways to tackle air pollution and found that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it’s often cheaper to change to clean sources of energy or improve energy efficiency than spend money on filters and other ‘end-of-pipe’ controls&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Specifically, about half of the investment should go into end-of-pipe solutions and half into clean energy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; In short, cleaning up the air will be easier and cost less, if shifting to clean energy is part of the toolbox&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e0af4527-b201-f371-e586-282449aa8a48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, a recent study by Greenpeace India found that 2/3 of existing coal-based thermal power plants in the country are so expensive to run that it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2018/01/05/india-solar-wind-air-pollution-coal/"&gt;would be cheaper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; to build new renewable energy plants to replace them. Saving money by cleaning up the air and cleaning up the energy mix – what’s not to like!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img title="Solar panels in Orissa " src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/141316_255292.jpg" alt="Solar panels in Orissa "&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Allowing fossil fuel driven pollution without limits makes electricity artificially cheap to the end user, but it also imposes enormous health costs on society. If we want to have clean air, then investing in filters and other pollution reduction technologies is vital while also emphasising on a long-term strategy to transition towards cleaner sources of energy sooner than later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauri Myllyvirta &lt;/strong&gt;is the Energy Analyst at Greenpeace East Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use my past experience and knowledge in a meaningful way and that is the main reason I joined Greenpeace as a Green Warrior volunteer. The knowledge and encouragement rendered at each step by Druhi Dasgupta, the Green Warrior Coordinator, was invaluable. I have participated in several activities and Greenpeace campaigns and I particularly enjoyed a recent activity at Bal Bharati School in Noida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four hours I spent there were such a wonderful and amazing experience for me, being with kids and explaining everything about our campaign and the environment was a fun and meaningful experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that by taking part in such volunteering activities I am not just spreading important information in society, but I also learn things myself. It also helps a lot in personality development as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially the students looked bored but when we started speaking and showed them our videos we gained momentum and received a good response from them. We then had a forest model building activity which everybody thoroughly enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked the students to prepare a forest model with materials we provided. Their ideas and creativity to demonstrate deforestation and pollution from industries was really inspiring. This proved to us that such activities not only spread knowledge but also helps in developing the inherent talent and creativity among students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt I found great satisfaction in being a part of such campaigns. It was an enlightening and highly fulfilling experience for me and I recommend it wholeheartedly! I look forward to being part of more such activities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;“Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached.” If Swami Vivekananda was still around, he might have repeated those famous words to get us to deal with air pollution. Delhi has been choking on toxic air, and alarmed residents want solutions. Our leaders and officials have started scrambling around to find quick remedies. Even the courts are having their say in the matter. &lt;/p&gt;

            Burning - one of the primary reasons for Air Pollution
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, all of us know that the air pollution time bomb has been ticking for many years now. In 2014, a WHO report declared Delhi as the most polluted city in the world, and recognised air pollution as the fifth largest killer in India. An aspiring world leader, India should never have waited to hear that from the WHO, but what’s worse is that even that wake-up call did little to galvanise our leaders and citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like everything else, air pollution hurts vulnerable people the most – children and the elderly for instance. In February 2015, Greenpeace India carried out an air quality monitoring survey in five schools in Delhi, which showed that PM2.5 levels were 10 times more than the safe limits prescribed by the WHO. At the very minimum, this means impaired lung functioning and respiratory problems in children. Two months later, the Central Government belatedly launched the National Air Quality Index (NAQI).

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box middle-box right"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;
        &lt;a class="open-img EnlargeImage" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2016/images/AP%201.jpg" title=""&gt;
            &lt;img id="ctl00_cphContentArea_epiEntryContent_ctl00_ctl04_Image1" class="Thumbnail" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/ReSizes/Medium/Global/india/2016/images/AP%201.jpg" alt="" style="border-width:0px;"&gt;
            
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="events-content"&gt;
        &lt;span class="date"&gt;24 November 2016&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Arise, Awake. India as a geograpy suffers from Air Pollution
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the WHO released fresh data showing that of the 20 most polluted cities in the world, 10 were in India. Gwalior, Allahabad, Patna, Raipur, Ludhiana, Kanpur and many other cities now made it to the list. Delhi had moved from most polluted city to the 11th most polluted city and this was interpreted by many media reports as an ‘improvement’, ignoring the fact that a large number of Indian cities were in the top 20, never mind others further down the list. This false sense of achievement has fortunately dissipated with this month’s renewed crisis in Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We launched our Clean Air Nation campaign in September 2015. We have released several reports that clearly show that the crisis in not limited to Delhi but covers the entire Indo-Gangetic Plains. Other regions and cities are not far behind. We have pointed out the current limitations of the NAQI. We have highlighted the large role of thermal power generation in causing air pollution, and we have shown exactly how and why even &lt;a title="Deaths due to outdoor air pollution in India and China - Greenpeace India report" href="https://secured-static.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2016/docs/Deaths-due-to-outdoor-air-pollution-in-India-and-China---Greenpeace-India-report.pdf?1"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; is doing so much better than us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="events-box middle-box left"&gt;
    &lt;div class="frame"&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Our Journey to a smog filled future? This is a wake up call
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;Our campaign is stepping up and we need more &lt;a title="Get Involved - Volunteer" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Get-Involved/Volunteer/"&gt;people power&lt;/a&gt; in order to win. We &lt;a title="Air Pollution its time we make it personal" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Air-Pollution-its-time-we-make-it-personal/"&gt;need citizens all over the country to join us&lt;/a&gt; in large numbers. This is a nationwide problem and requires concerted action.
&lt;p&gt;Our demands to the government are clear. First, fix the gaps in the NAQI and make real time information widely available all over the country. We need to know the quality of the air we are breathing and what’s making it toxic. Issue health advisories when the air is bad; tell us what precautions we need to take to reduce the worst impacts. And next, more importantly, come up with a lasting solution. Address the root causes. Draft a comprehensive National Clean Air Action Plan to tackle all sources of pollution in a time-bound manner, in all regions of the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean air is our birth right. Our children deserve better. &lt;a title="Sign CleanAirNation Petition" href="http://act.greenpeace.in/cleanairnation/?utm_campaign=cleanairnation&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_source=greenpeace-org&amp;amp;utm_content=sign-our-petition"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign our petition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - let us join hands to shape a healthy future for our country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeds, and thereby food crops are at the very centre of a nation’s survival. It is no wonder then that corporations and governments have been trying for decades to control seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India as a nation has fought against the entry of Genetically Modified (GM) food in the form of food aid from USA back in 2002. Then in 2010, following an uproar by scientists, academics, states, questioning the gaping holes in regulation, science and questioning the very need of the crop, Mr. Jairam Ramesh, the then Minister of Environment and Forests announced an indefinite moratorium on Bt brinjal a Mahyco/Monsanto product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in 2012, the Supreme Court’s Technical Expert Committee’s strongly recommended a 10 year moratorium on large scale field trials and thereby commercialization of any GMOs in the country. The 31 member cross party Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture also expressed serious reservations on GMOs pointing to gaping holes in regulation,  growing science against GMOs, and suggesting that alternatives be considered first. Yet, once every few years Government after Government tries to push GMOs through a broken regulatory system that cannot protect its own people. And usually, in a very secretive manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/119343_201403.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;History of Failure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bt Cotton is so far the only GM crop that’s grown in India. However, its success has been limited to geography and chronology. It has only managed to work in irrigated areas, which is just a one-third of the total land under agriculture, and has been a disaster for the rain-fed areas. The increase in yield could also be attributed to the hybridization process. Bollworms, the key pest against which Bt was engineered, grew resistant to it within a few years. To make matter worse, secondary pests like whitefly, which were non-threatening in the past, are now wiping out entire regions of Bt Cotton. This year, organic cotton farms in Punjab were like oases of prosperity amidst large scale despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the recent ban on cultivation of GM crops by 17 European countries and four regions in two other EU countries, the resistance to this unsustainable technology is getting stronger across the world. Emergence of Superweeds in USA has rendered a large chunk of land under this technology unusable. Trade restrictions on GM crops have resulted in loss of billions of dollars for American farmers when China rejected their consignments of corn contaminated by unauthorised genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the bureaucracy and the government to still walk this line when we have our own wealth of ecological agriculture wisdom to share with the world, is indeed grave news for farmers and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Modified Mustard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM Mustard, the research for which is funded by Dhara Oils and done by Delhi University is the latest entrant to the debate. This GM Mustard (DHM11) is Herbicide Resistant to Glufosinate, a herbicide produced by Bayer. This implies that this herbicide can be sprayed without check to kill weeds, posing a grave risk to us consumers as it is highly persistent and labeled as “high risk to mammals” by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA 2005). The chemical is not easily destroyed by cooking the food item in boiling water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise in productivity, which is being attributed to DHM11 is essentially a result of the hybridization process and has no relation with genetic modification. A non-GM hybrid has the same yield levels without the risk posed by genetic engineering. Thus, the only group it benefits is the seed companies and corporations like Bayer who will see a spike in their profits at the farmer’s cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Imminent Danger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The states where 70% of mustard in India is grown have refused to field test this variety. Careless monitoring and contamination reports were cited at the trial sites. Dr. Deepak Pental, the developer, told journalists from Down To Earth that “it is wrong to claim that transgenes won’t move to non-transgenic material. If you have a selection over it like a herbicide, then they spread very quickly.” Even the farmers who chose to grow non-GM, will be left helpless in the face of contamination. The yield is comparable to many safe high-yielding non-GM varieties with no added production benefits. Even at such an advanced research stage the biosafety data, which gives an indication of the safety of product for consumption is being denied to public. And now we hear everywhere the reports of its impending commercialisation without even a guarantee for our people’s own safety. Is it government’s apathy towards people who voted it to power or a verdict of our inefficient and corrupt bureaucratic system? Either way it’s enough to shake up anyone who still cares for their food and cherishes sarson ka saag, saag ghosht, mustard oil and seasoning in our favourite curries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me in telling the government to put a stop to GM Mustard. &lt;a title="Say No to GM Mustard" href="http://act.greenpeace.in/sustainable-agriculture/gm-mustard/" target="_blank"&gt;Take action now&lt;/a&gt; - we only have a few weeks to say #NoGMMustard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every voice counts.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the history of GM crops in India, why the BRAI (The Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India) Bill fails and its current status and petition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 1px; border: 1px solid black; vertical-align: text-top;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/85300_137362.jpg" alt="Various organisations including Greenpeace India launched a nation-wide campaign on June 25 demanding that the BRAI Bill, 2013, be withdrawn immediately"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Various organisations including Greenpeace India launched a nation-wide campaign on June 25 demanding that the BRAI Bill, 2013, be withdrawn immediately&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most people, I prefer eating organic, healthy and nutritious food that is not laden with toxins – neither in the form of pesticides and hormones, nor in the form of any genetic modification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why I'm not only against chemical farming, but strongly oppose the introduction of genetically modified food into our food system – into our fields, and finally onto our plates. But my concerns regarding this have been steadily rising in recent times, as our existing regulatory mechanism for Genetic Engineering technology is not only insufficient and faulty, but not at all people-oriented. Our Government has been persistently trying to push GM food onto our plate, without doing a proper, independent, and long-term bio-safety testing and assessment of GM crops, and without letting me, as a citizen have a say and 'choose' what food I want to eat. It has allowed powerful multinational seed companies like Monsanto to set up shops in India over a decade ago, whose sole mission is to take control of our food and farming and therefore our national sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The History of GM crops in India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2001 – It all started with allowing the commercial cultivation of India's first GM crop – the Bt Cotton. This occurred after it was already discovered to have spread illegally through transgenic contamination on thousands of hectares. Introduction of Bt Cotton in India was initially brought in, on claims of reduced insecticide usage and higher yield. But instead, we actually saw an increased use of pesticides- much more than what was used prior to 2002 when Bt Cotton was first approved. Further, we also saw increased rates of debt-ridden farmer suicides in the Vidarbha region, due to massive crop failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2005 – 2009 – The Govt. signed an agreement with a leading seed company, Mahyco (the Indian subsidiary of Monsanto), and the University of Agricultural Sciences in Dharwad and Coimbatore, TN, to develop India's first GM food crop – the Bt Brinjal, for commercial cultivation. It was cleared for commercialization by the GEAC in 2009. Amidst much public protests, and months of RTI battles by scientists and environmental activists, the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) was forced to make public the bio-safety assessment data on Bt Brinjal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally in 2010, after holding nation-wide consultations on this controversial food crop, the then Minister of Environment and Forests, Jairam Ramesh decided to "adopt a cautious, precautionary principle-based approach," and imposed an indefinite moratorium/ ban on the open release of genetically engineered Bt Brinjal, which was approved by the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee of the Ministry on October 14, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 4px 10px; border: 1px solid black; float: left;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/85306_137369.jpg" alt="Bt brinjal protest"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the story did not end there. In 2009-2010, our Government under the Ministry of Science and Technology, came up with a new Bill – The Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India (BRAI) Bill, for biotechnology regulation in India. It was drafted in total secrecy, with no opportunity for the general public to provide any feedback or participate and comment on a legislation which deals with something of this magnitude - the safety of our food. Further in 2011, Monsanto India was allowed to carry on open-field trials of its herbicide-resistant GM corn in Bijapur, Karnataka, and a few other sites across the country. Documents accessed through RTI later revealed that these trials were conducted without proper approval. After gross violations were detected, the Govt. of Karnataka was forced to ban all field trials of GM crops across the state. Thereafter, several other states followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding The BRAI (The Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India) Bill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in 2009, that The Ministry of Science and Technology, Govt. of India, drafted this Bill in its present form. Though it's content was not made public and was supposedly kept as a secret document, it was leaked out in March 2010. This Bill seeks to give easy access to GM crops in India. It provides a single window fast-track approval for GM crops, overriding the State's authority over agriculture and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bill through its Section 28, classifies some information as "confidential commercial information" and leaves it to the discretion of BRAI officials to disclose information. It also has a clause where the authority chair and members subscribe to an oath of secrecy, thereby making biotechnology non-transparent in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aruna Roy, who was a memberof theNational Advisory Council (NAC) , headed by the UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi says "The Bill is a travesty of transparency and democratic decision-making on a matter that will affect every citizen, as it intends to promote use of modern biotechnology in agriculture".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Touted as the "Wrong bill by the wrong people, for the wrong reasons", it has been rightly called India's Monsanto Protection and Promotion Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though "this Bill claims to take care of the deficiencies in the existing system of approval for GM crops, it turns out that the Bill is unconstitutional, unethical, unscientific, self-contradictory and not people-oriented", as stated by India's foremost and eminent micro-biologist and former V.C. of National Knowledge Commission, Pushpa M. Bhargava. "If passed it will seriously and adversely affect agriculture, health of humans, animals, and environment, causing unparalleled harm", he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does this Bill Fail?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong Ministry Tabling the Bill and Housing the Authority – The nodal ministry for the UN Convention on Biological Diversity is the Ministry for Environment &amp;amp; Forests, and yet the Ministry of Science and Technology has tabled the Bill. Further, the Ministry of S&amp;amp;T is a promoter of Biotechnology and has spent huge amounts of funds for R&amp;amp;D in this field. Promoters cannot be regulators, as there is an inherent conflict of interest there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 1px; border: 1px solid black; vertical-align: middle;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/85307_137371.jpg" alt="Over 2,000 people came together on August 8 for a day-long protest against the BRAI bill and Monsanto."&gt;Over 2,000 people came together on August 8 for a day-long protest against the BRAI bill and Monsanto.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Public Consultation and Lack of Democratic Functioning - This Bill does not propose civil society participation or mandatory public consultations anywhere, nor will it accept complaints from civil society, despite the fact that this directly and indirectly affects every citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over-riding State Govenments' authority over their agriculture and health – It is unconstitutional, as agriculture is a State subject, and it takes away from the State government the authority to take decisions on GM plant products. It is worthwhile noting here that earlier in 2009-2010, more than 10 states had formally declared that they will not permit Bt Brinjal to be released in their territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Need Assessment or Assessment of Alternatives Built into Regulation – It has no provisions for need assessment or assessment of alternatives to precede any processing of applications, nor does it consider whether the deployment of transgenics is ethically and socially justifiable. It does not take into account other alternative technologies like smart or molecular breeding, organic agriculture, or use of Integrated Pest Management or bio-pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bypassing the RTI Act – Article 23 of the Bill states the information declared by BRAI "confidential commercial information" will not come under the RTI Act. So there is no way for civil society to challenge its decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Independent Long Term Testing Regime Laid Down – This Bill does not make independent, long term testing a mandatory part of the regulation, despite the Bt Brinjal moratorium decision resting on the need for such testing. Further, it does not make biosafety testing precede open air field trials, even though there are grave environmental hazards of releasing such unknown, uncharacterized organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No mention of Mandatory Labeling – There is no mention of mandatory labeling of GM food products. And that takes away from us our right to 'choose' what food we want to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No protection for farmers, whose fields growing natural non-GMO crops get contaminated with a GM product of the neighboring farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weak Penal Clauses – The Bill has no liability clauses laid down. Instead it has a an Article 62 under "Offenses and Penalties" which implies that anyone making a statement about a GM crop which BRAI decides is false and misleading, shall be punished with imprisonment for upto three months!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 1px; border: 1px solid black; vertical-align: middle;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/85301_137360.jpg" alt="Over 2,000 people came together on August 8 for a day-long protest against the BRAI bill and Monsanto."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Status of the BRAI Bill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BRAI bill was first proposed after the the moratorium on BT brinjal in 2010. But instead of paying heed to the voice of the nation, and establishing a strong regulatory mechanism to protect our health, environment and livelihoods, the Govt. yet again tabled the Bill in the Budget session of the Parliament, on April 22, 2013, again amidst huge protests both from within and outside the Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bill was introduced, despite the recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture, who in its report in August 2012, clearly pointed out serious issues with regard to our transgenic research and regulation, and also confirmed GM contamination. It asked for a bio-safety law to be brought in instead. Even the Technical Expert Committee of the Supreme Court (SC TEC) made recommendations on similar lines, and stated that open air field trials of GM crops have to be stopped!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst all the vociferous opposition to the Bill from all quarters, it was then referred to the Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment and Forests which notified that public feedback on the Bill can be provided for 30 days from June 10, 2013, and then subsequently extended the deadline to an additional 45 days, until August 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bill now lies in the current Monsoon session of the Parliament, and is now being reviewed by the Standing Committee on Science , Technology, Environment and Forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is now a rising demand both online and on ground to either withdraw the Bill or to send it to a joint parliamentary committee to ensure that all concerns are addressed. August 8, 2013 saw a massive rally in New-Delhi on Parliament Street, where farmers from 20 states across India, along with active citizens, environment activists, and some political leaders, gathered to protest and demand the withdrawal of the BRAI bill and to stop promoting GM crops in the country. And also demanding that Monsanto abandon all its programs in India.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><subtitle>Demands a public consultation involving domestic consumers</subtitle><tags>renewables</tags><text>&lt;h2&gt;Demands a public consultation involving domestic consumers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	New Delhi, 17th December 2013: Greenpeace submitted its suggestions and objections to the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) proposal on net metering and connectivity in respect of rooftop solar here on Monday.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"We would like to place on record that this proposal is highly in favour of private DISCOMs, protecting their business interest and undermining general consumers' interest and clean energy development benefits. We have submitted our objections to the commission and are hopeful of a robust and ambitious net metering policy. Further we also demand a public consultation on the revised proposal involving all stakeholders including domestic consumers," said Abhishek Pratap, Senior Campaigner, Greenpeace India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following are clauses in the proposal where we have serious concerns and would like the commission to look into and make suitable amendments so that both the interest of DISCOMs and consumers are protected while NCT of Delhi will be taken take out of the looming electricity crisis through massive uptake of rooftop solar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clause 3.2 - Capacity Limits: The proposal seeks to limit the capacity of rooftop solar PV to the sanctioned load of the consumers. There is no clear explanation given in the proposal for limiting the capacity. If the capacity is limited to the sanctioned load, then in practical sense, it is about self-consumption and nothing can be fed into the grid. The proposal, in its introduction, talks about global best practices on rooftop solar PV projects but the capacity limits are contradictory to that. Therefore, we urge DERC to amend this provision of capacity limit with sanctioned load of the consumers to available roof-space of the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clause 3.4 - Restrictions on level of overall or local grid penetration: This provision seeks to limit the overall cumulative capacity to 15 % of the total capacity of the particular distribution transformer. There is no clear technical reasoning for such limitation. Although, the provision talks about large number of rooftop solar impacting the local grid from technical, safety and security issues, these do not stand convincing from technical point of view. If high number of rooftop solar proliferates in a particular distribution transformer, there will be requirement for upgrading such transformers to accept such loads. Highly efficient transformers which can accept high level of distributed generation are available in the market. Instead of upgrading local distribution infrastructure to meet the demand of rooftop solar, the provision of limiting the cumulative capacity of rooftop solar PV is not in the direction of taking NCT of Delhi out of power crisis. Therefore, we urge DERC to remove this provision from the proposal or provide higher cumulative capacity for rooftop solar PV for particular distribution transformers in the range of minimum 40 %.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clause 4 (ii) - Energy Accounting: The provision seeks to cap electricity generated from a rooftop solar system at 90 % of the electricity consumption by the eligible consumer at the end of settlement period. On the other hand, no carry forward provision is provided to the eligible consumers. We have serious concern over this provision in the proposal as this is heavily loaded in favour of DISCOMs and will push back individual consumers from early adoption of rooftop solar. This provision in conjunction with capacity limits acts as disincentive for general consumers to go for rooftop solar and creates a disabling environment for solar energy in NCT of Delhi. Therefore, we urge DERC to remove this provision from the proposal or provide carry forward for excess electricity generation for next financial year along with this provision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clause 4 (iii) – Billing and Payment: The provision seeks to provide lowest applicable tariff across all slots for the consumer to feed solar electricity into the grid. This is another objectionable provision in the proposal which acts as disincentive for general consumers to go for rooftop solar. This provision also stands in contradiction with introduction of this proposal which seeks to make rooftop solar in NCT of Delhi at a global standard. General norms in global best practices are to provide highest available tariff to encourage consumers to go for solar electricity generation and feed into the grid at peak time. Therefore, we urge DERC to replace lowest applicable tariff across all slots with highest applicable tariff across all slots to create incentive for general consumers for solar electricity generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No mention of target: The entire proposal lacks in terms of overall vision and roadmap for development of rooftop solar PV projects in the NCT of Delhi. Although proposal seeks to establish proliferation of rooftop solar PV in Delhi, there is no mention of target for electricity generation from rooftop solar system. Therefore, we would urge DERC to provide electricity generation target from rooftop solar in the revised proposal which should be at least 2 GW by year 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

	 New Delhi 15th December 2015: A ranking of the 17 cities covered by the National Air Quality Index (NAQI) was released by Greenpeace India today, and reveals data to challenge the complacence of the Central and State Governments regarding cities other than Delhi: as many as fifteen of the 17 Indian cities with NAQI stations showed levels of air pollution that far exceed the prescribed Indian standards. Indeed, the shockingly high pollution figures recorded for well over 50% of the times that data was recorded between April and November indicate the continuing severity of the Air Pollution disaster.[1]
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;“As the political capital - and indeed, the most polluted of all cities - the bad air in Delhi gets the most attention. But, scratch below the murky surface, and you will find concentrations of PM2.5 in several other cities - Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Muzzafarpur and Faridabad, amongst others - that would justify the triggering of a ‘Red Alert.’ Even the government’s own, largely inadequate NAQI data reveals that 23 of the 32 stations across India are showing more than 70% exceedance of the national standards,” said Sunil Dahiya, Campaigner, Greenpeace India, “The pollution levels in a few Indian cities have the embarrassing distinction of having exceeded the toxic levels of Beijing and other Chinese cities, demonstrating levels at least ten times higher than the WHO standards, making air pollution truly a national emergency.”[2]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As part of the first such initiative on analysing air pollution data, Sunil Dahiya added, “The NAQI, in its present form, fails to acknowledge the scale of the problem.  Data is only available in seventeen cities, which is a shockingly low number considering the size of our country. There is an immediate need to diversify and upgrade the manual stations to ambient air quality monitoring stations feeding data to the online NAQI portal. The existing system needs to include short and long-term solutions and advisories.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;India’s NAQI system remains poor, with most prominent cities lacking real time monitoring stations, far behind the standards followed in the top 20 biggest cities of European Union, US and China. On average, there are four air quality stations in cities in EU countries, five in US cities, and eight in Chinese cities displaying real time pollution levels,  whereas 10 of India’s biggest cities do not even have a single such monitoring station.[3]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace is calling for an ambitious and systematic Clean Air action plan, with focused targets, clear timelines and demonstrable accountability towards public health. The right combination of policies including power generation, industry, transport and agriculture, can help India take major strides towards resolving this slow-burning disaster. “This crisis is an opportunity to test India’s emergency response plan and design coordinated action plans for a ‘Clean Air Nation,’” concluded Dahiya.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Further information-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Madhulika Verma, Communication Specialist, Greenpeace India; 9971137736, &lt;img class="obfimg Eoi_1" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Templates/Planet3/Styles/Images/emailimages/dfcc049ef56078a7b5a187df9e2af3f9.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

	National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) good start but needs transparent action: Greenpeace India
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Delhi March 12 2018 |&lt;/strong&gt; Greenpeace India accessed exclusive &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2018/Concept_note_for_national_clean_air_programme_greenpeace_india.pdf"&gt;concept document of National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)&lt;/a&gt;, a flagship program of MoEF&amp;amp;CC to mitigate nationwide air pollution health emergency. The document obtained through the Right to Information application shows multiple aspects of the program along with initiatives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The announcement of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2018/Concept_note_for_national_clean_air_programme_greenpeace_india.pdf"&gt;National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)&lt;/a&gt; was made on December 18th 2017 to a reply in the Rajya Sabha by the Minister of Environment Forest Climate Change. The framework points out aspects which are good steps towards formulating an action plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sunil Dahiya, Senior Campaigner, Greenpeace India said “it is good to see government’s growing concentration towards air pollution, however there is an ambiguity on the planning given the lack of information on public domain regarding NCAP, there has to be a transparency of information in the public domain and inclusive public participation starting from planning level. The concept note on the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) is a big step in the right direction to achieve breathable air across the country and we hope that CPCB and MOEF&amp;amp;CC along with other ministries and departments come up with a detailed action plan soon and inform the public.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lacks Specificity, Timelines and Directions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The draft in its existing form has no reference of specific management activities and source based initiatives for implementation of air quality management systems. “ The draft needs more thinking and clarity in terms of articulating interim milestones for completing source apportionment studies to reduce 35% &amp;amp; 50% pollution in three and five years respectively along with specific targets for polluting sectors such power and industry”; said Dahiya.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthening Monitoring &amp;amp; Evaluation Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace India &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2018/Airpocalypse_II_29Jan18.pdf"&gt;Airpocalypse II&lt;/a&gt; report highlighted that more than 80% of cities in the country where air quality is monitored are severely polluted and it impacts 47 million children across the country. Also, 580 millions number of people in India don't even have a single air quality monitoring stations in districts they are living. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;NCAP emphasizes on increasing manual monitoring station from 684 to 1000 stations across the country and CAAQMS to 268 from existing 84 which is a good step. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning from Thermal Power Plants Emission Standards Notification, Dec 2015&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace hopes that the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) should not follow the precedent set by what is happening with the new emission standards for coal based power plants (communicated in December 2015). Even after the stipulated deadline (December 2017) not even a single power plant complies to the norms and we are still facing the public health emergency of high air pollution levels originating from power sector.&lt;br&gt;“The fact that this concept note is not even available in the public domain raises concerns on how the government is going to make the NCAP a truly participatory initiative. It’s important that all discussions and documents regard to NCAP to be available in the public domain and people are informed of planning, implementation and progress made through press briefings and other channels”, concludes Dahiya.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights of National Clean Air Programme based on NCAP concept note and minutes of the discussions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;National Clean Air Programme framework has the following aspects which is the right beginning towards formulating region/state/city centric action plans.&lt;br&gt;    1.    The discussion within MoEF&amp;amp;CC signifies a target of 35% reduction of air pollution in the next three years and 50% reduction in the next five years for at-least 100 cities across India.&lt;br&gt;    2.    The framework emphasizes on increasing manual monitoring station from 684 to 1000 stations across the country and CAAQMS to 268 from existing 84. &lt;br&gt;    3.    Increasing PM2.5 monitoring infrastructure from 67 stations to all NAMP stations (proposed number is 1000)&lt;br&gt;    4.    Tackling pollution from various sources across the country, identifies power, transport, industry, residential and agriculture sectors and along with inter-city regional pollution background from areas outside city boundary limits, i.e., interstate approaches&lt;br&gt;    5.    Data dissemination to the public, inclusive public participation on planning and implementation for the National Clean Air Programme&lt;br&gt;    6.    Setting up of Air Information Center for data analysis, interpretation, dissemination including GIS platforms&lt;br&gt;    7.    Envisaging Air Quality Forecasting System as a state of the art modeling system, which forecasts the following day’s air quality.&lt;br&gt;    8.    Building up of an updated national emission inventory etc.&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes to Editor-&lt;br&gt;    1.    NCAP Concept Note- &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2018/Concept_note_for_national_clean_air_programme_greenpeace_india.pdf"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2018/Concept_note_for_national_clean_air_programme_greenpeace_india.pdf &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    1.    Greenpeace India Airpocalypse II Report- &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2018/Airpocalypse_II_29Jan18.pdf"&gt;www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2018/Airpocalypse_II_29Jan18.pdf  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Further details-&lt;br&gt;Madhulika Verma, Senior Media Specialist, 9971137736, &lt;img class="obfimg Eoi_1" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Templates/Planet3/Styles/Images/emailimages/dfcc049ef56078a7b5a187df9e2af3f9.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

				&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Science and scientists have always played a huge role in shaping the course of civilizations over thousands of years.  India in the last 60 years too has been the beneficiary of great strides made in science. But there has also been a growing realization in hindsight that the checks and balances put on scientific innovation cannot be merely from a single prism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first green revolution in India in the 60s helped by Norman Borlaug’s advances in hybridization, modern cropping and irrigation techniques and the introduction of chemical fertilizers and pesticides had a rapid effect in bolstering India’s food production in the early years. Now more than 40 years later, it is evident that the spread of chemical intensive agriculture has destroyed soil fertility with the rampant use of chemicals. It has also thrown up huge issues for our country in terms of stagnating and/ or declining food production and also the biggest threat of them all- the issue of food safety. Or the lack of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This clearly implies that it is essential for any major scientific technology to undergo a stringent evaluation process, also encompassing the complete spectrum of their implications for the environment, biodiversity and human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is best defined by the Precautionary Principle which was expounded at the Rio Earth Summit of 1992 which states,” In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.&lt;sup&gt;” &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also an integral aspect of the Cartagena Protocol on Bio Safety, the international treaty that deals with the handling, transfer and the use of genetically modified organisms, of which India is a signatory. So then the next urgent, immediate question that pops up in my head is, “Why are sections of the government encouraging the commercialization of GM Mustard in our country?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;GM Mustard (DMH 11), funded by the National Dairy Development Board and developed by a team led by Dr Deepak Pental at Delhi University, faces imminent commercialization by the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee under the Ministry of Environment &amp;amp; Forests. And this is in spite of no biosafety data on the GMO being made public (repeated RTI queries by activists have been turned down) and in the light of the issue being sub judice in the Supreme Court and when a SC appointed technical committee has recommended a moratorium on all field trials of GMOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are a huge number of concerns over the entry of GMOS and this has also been highlighted by the plight bt cotton has put farmers in in India, I want to address one primary aspect- the question of choice. Deepak Pental, the key scientist behind the DMH 11 GM Mustard openly admitted in 2012 that transgenes would move to non-transgenic materials. This would imply loss of all traditional varieties of the mustard variety. &lt;a title="" name="_ftnref1" href="file:///C:/Users/ruhkumar/Desktop/GM/Mustard%20blog.docx#_ftn1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that would mean that you will lose the one thing that you still have a right to- the right to choose!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I am not a scientist. But I sure do know that I do not want something on my plate that is potentially unsafe. And what takes the cake is that, with time, I won’t even be able to say no to it, unless I say no to sambhar, which I’ve grown up on, and sarson ka saag, which I’ve come to love, and tadka in my curries. One thing I know- I definitely can’t do without my sambhar! Can you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s also not forget that unlike some of the effects of the Green Revolution which are reversible, there’s no turning back with GMOs! &lt;span&gt;Join me in telling the government to put a stop to GM Mustard. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="zoom" title="Say No to GM Mustard" href="http://act.greenpeace.in/sustainable-agriculture/gm-mustard/" target="_blank"&gt;Take action now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; - we only have a few weeks to say #NoGMMustard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many of you have paid thousands to get this treatment done in spas? Well I have always been curious about these treatments. But I the idea finding it out in a spa, was not too appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in Junglistan, this is one of the many luxuries you can get free of cost. In the afternoon, sometimes when I get bored I just go and stand in the shallow stream where hundreds of fish feast on the dead skin of my feet.  Let me say it again, free of cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 1px; border: 1px solid black; float: right;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/54134_102040.jpg" alt="Countdown Brikesh's tree house" width="384" height="283"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 11 at the tree house and its been a rather quiet day. Started my day with a bucket bath in the river and I needed it badly. For the last 2 days the river water has been very muddy thanks to the constant drizzling. So I could neither shower in the rain nor use the river water but fortunately I woke up to a clear shallow river and had a refreshing bucket bath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight for the day has been the bamboo shoots subzi.  Nine year old Swapnil, who lives in the village nearby, brought it for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week ago I had mentioned in my update that I saw these kids carrying some bamboo shoots home and I asked them if they could get me some of the local bamboo preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kids kept their promise. Swapnil says he cooked it and I have no option but to believe him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: text-top; margin: 1px; border: 1px solid black;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/54133_102042.jpg" alt="Swapnil with the bamboo shoot"&gt;Rohit (in-front holding the bamboo shoot) and his brother Swapnil (behind).&lt;/h5&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stay up-to-date on news related to the environment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerala has become the first Indian state to create a very ambitious project to generate over 10 MW of solar power through over 10,000 roof-top solar power systems of one kw each. Anybody living in Kerala with 15 square meters of sunny rooftop area can register for this programme. The innovative scheme was launched by Farooq Abdullah, minister for new and renewable energy (MNRE) on February 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: left;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/65625_116591.jpg" alt="solar panel, solar power" width="300" height="200"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very big program provided to Kerala with an overall expenditure of over Rs 175 crores and budgetary support of over Rs 80 crores from MNRE. The second phase of this project aims to reach over 50,000 households in Kerala and a subsidy of Rs 20 crore will be provided by the MNRE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project comes under the Solar Off-Grid Photovoltaic program of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission ( JNNSM). It was launched in 2010 with a target to achieve 200 MW of off-grid solar applications by March 2013. This excludes 20 Million Solar Home Systems that will be installed by 2022. The ministry has sanctioned similar projects to other states as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BASIC meet to be held in Chennai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year Chennai has been chosen to host the BASIC meetings. BASIC is a platform where four countries, namely Brazil, South Africa, India and China participate in and meet to coordinate on climate change related issues. The first meeting of this year will see environment ministers from these countries discuss the implementation of decisions made at the Doha Climate Change Conference in 2012. All ministers except the Chinese environment minister have confirmed their presence at the meet scheduled for Feb 15 and 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/66889_118027.jpg" alt="basic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, BASIC has become a significant voice in climate change negotiations, especially when it comes to highlighting the issues faced by developing nations. In Chennai the group hopes to develop steps to reach agreements under the Durban platform and increase efforts to effectively deal with climate change. This year, representatives of other important members of G-77 have also been invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birds in India also affected by climate change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study in the Global Change Biology journal has warned that climate change is posing a serious threat to a number of bird species in Asia, including ones in India. The only way to subdue the repercussions of climate change on birds is to significantly increase protection of sensitive areas that birds visit in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: right;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/66890_118025.jpg" alt="bird" width="302" height="200"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted on over 350 Asian bird species, whose continued survival is already a cause for concern. The study mainly focussed on the biodiversity hotspots of Eastern Himalayas and the lower Mekong River basin regions in Bhutan, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Nepal and India. It pointed out that the conservation of species will largely depend on how well the protected sites are managed and if there is free movement for the birds from one site to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satellite identifies huge lake in the Himalayas with a potential to burst&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) in Hyderabad, a satellite-based study has determined that a very large glacial lake has formed atop the Himalayas in Sikkim. The lake contains 19.7 billion litres of water and has a very high potential to rupture at any time causing flooding and devastation downstream. The lake has formed at the snout of the South Lhonak glacier, which is around 7,000 metres high. It is only surrounded by soil and debris so it’s not in a stable condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/66891_118023.jpg" alt="himalayas"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the report published in the last issue of the Current Science journal researchers have said that the lake is about 630 metres wide and 20 metres deep and covers an area of 98.7 hectares. They do admit that warnings are based on their initial judgment and further field trials are required to determine exact dangers.&lt;/p&gt;

	DHARAMSALA, India — On 19th April 2004, a group of seventeen people from Greenpeace Germany, Switzerland and India embarked on a journey to Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, to participate in the first ‘Solar Generation’ project in India. Together with youngsters from the Tibetan Children’s Village (TCV), Greenpeace installed a 2KW solar generator to provide electricity to a school in Dharamsala.

            Notes from the Solar Generation Diaries
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deb Kumar Chatterjee, New Delhi: My name is Deb and I work with
the Greenpeace Direct Dialogue Team in New Delhi. Last week I had
the privilege of being in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh with an
international, multi-cultural team working on the Solar
Generation's first project in India. I'd like to share some of my
experiences from this trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started our journey from New Delhi at six o'clock in the
morning on 19th April, after an introduction with our international
visitors. 17 people in all left for Dharamsala - though everyone
was in high spirits, we were also keeping to ourselves a little
bit, since we were new to each other. But as with all long
journeys, by the end of our 14 hour road trip to Dharamsala, we had
befriended the others well enough to be singing songs together in
German, Hindi and English! By the end of the first day we felt like
a strong team, and got the feeling that we knew each other
well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This long journey made me realize how passionate the German
students were about our Solar Generation project - it also made me
realize why Greenpeace Germany is considered very strong; they have
found youngsters with the potential to be 'future leaders' who can
convey their message to future generations. It was a great learning
process for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, it was great to wake up in this beautiful
place at an altitude of 1817 m above sea level - and even better to
have breakfast in the Tibetan Children's Village canteen, along
with the rest of the German team. We were already beginning to feel
like old friends! The bad news was that three of our German friends
had fallen ill, and needed to rest a little. After breakfast, we
were formally welcomed by the Director of the TCV and introduced to
the 12 Tibetan school students who would be working with us on this
project. Our new Tibetan friends took us on a quick tour of their
village after which we went for a slightly more formal presentation
on the TCV. After lunch we heard a presentation about climate
change by Fiona Koza (Greenpeace India Energy Campaign), and
another presentation by Sven Teske (Greenpeace Germany Energy
Campaign) about solar conversion devices. One thing amply clear to
us by now, is that in the coming years, much of India's fossil fuel
reserves will be gone, and at a great cost to our own future. If we
are to have a clean, sustainable future, we must urgently switch to
renewable energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sachin Singh, Mumbai: Hi, I'm Sachin, a Direct Dialogue
recruiter from the Mumbai team. I too had a great time working on
the Dharamsala project, with Greenpeace teams from 3 countries
working with the students of the TCV. It's great to feel that
together we are actually doing something to make our planet safer
and cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of our first combined exercises, we brainstormed for
hours and came up with the single message we want to put out to the
world through this project - "One Sun, one Earth, one Future, ACT
NOW"!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We painted this message on a huge banner on the third day of our
trip, and apart from the fun we had, and the satisfaction of our
positive action, I felt a deep sense of satisfaction in the common
hope we all harbour in our hearts - the sense that even though we
belong to different countries and different cultures, and spoke
different languages, we are all united in our efforts to save the
planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging by our collective enthusiasm, I am convinced that it is
we, the youth who are going to make a difference. And at the end of
this small note, I would like to send a message to India and the
whole world: we must save our planet and we must act now to do
so!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan Schlenk, Hannover, Germany:I joined the Greenpeace Germany
'Green Team' in 1995, and have been a part of Greenpeace projects
ever since. I first came to Dharamsala for a school volunteer
project in 2002, and liked the place so much that I came back three
more times! I brought up the idea of the Solar PV electricity
supply to the TCV school with Greenpeace Germany in October 2002,
after which I discussed it with the Director of the TCV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it has taken one-and-a-half years for this project to
materialize, I am happy to see it finally bear fruit. I believe
this project is a wonderful beginning towards educating students
about Renewable Energy sources. I particularly enjoyed the
exchanges between the Swiss, German, Indian and Tibetan children,
and I do hope that it is only the start of a long relationship!&lt;/p&gt;

	DHARAMSALA, India — On 19th April 2004, a group of seventeen people from Greenpeace Germany, Switzerland and India embarked on a journey to Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, to participate in the first ‘Solar Generation’ project in India. Together with youngsters from the Tibetan Children’s Village (TCV), Greenpeace installed a 2KW solar generator to provide electricity to a school in Dharamsala. Here are first-hand accounts from some of them.

	&lt;span&gt;Do you remember how citizens collectively ensured that GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) like Bt brinjal, which are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;unneeded, unwanted and unsafe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, do not enter our food plates or our farms back in 2010? Back then, the government said it was placing the GMO on an indefinite moratorium being “responsive to society and responsible to science”. &lt;strong&gt;Further, 15 years of Bt cotton cultivation in India exposed the hype and lies around this GMO too – the insect for which Bt cotton has been created has developed resistance, and farmers are using more pesticides than ever before on cotton crop in the country.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Now, in 2016, there is another GM food crop which is being pushed for commercial cultivation approval. An application for the release of mustard, that ubiquitous crop that all of us are familiar with – is in an advanced stage of processing by the Indian regulators. The application, with a biosafety dossier that claims to have completed all required tests and studies to assess the impacts of this GMO as per the Indian regulatory guidelines, has been submitted to the apex regulatory body called Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), constituted under the Environment Protection Act’s 1989 Rules in the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India. And seems like the GEAC might just go ahead with the commercial cultivation of GM Mustard.
It is said that more than 100 crores of taxpayers’ funds have been spent to develop and test these GMOs, with funding to Centre for Genetic Manipulation Crop Plants from National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) and Department of Biotechnology in the Ministry of Science &amp;amp; Technology (Reference). Ironically, the NDDB has wound up its edible oil business related to Dhara brand and has stopped its funding to the project now, while citizens have been kept in the dark about taxpayers’ funds being used for thrusting a GM food crop onto them.

&lt;span&gt;Still finding reasons to say no to GMO? We give you a few here -&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Transgenic technology is unsafe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Genetic Engineering is an unnatural and imprecise breeding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;technology with living organisms, and there is enough evidence that it is an unstable, unpredictable, irreversible and uncontrollable technology being deployed in our food and farming systems. This then has implications for our health and environment. Further, increased riskiness in agriculture, lack of choices for farmers and consumers, market rejection are all &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://indiagminfo.org/?p=657"&gt;&lt;span&gt;consequences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of the environmental release of GMOs.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/etMkrInS49CyF-NBhlQ8Q_c7_UDqj66kB8JzNu_nS0V379Dmb7Sz2m5Lzr28puZXmjv6qoloxlKhtVYp6ivdIK7rUTOChInIeXrCW3NzD-9T24TxRd4qqqdgRqCz5qj182nuKr0u" alt="giphy.gif" width="500" height="370"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;GM Hybrid Technology (HT) crops cause numerous adverse impacts, for farmers, agri-workers and consumers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Herbicide Tolerant GM crops like the current GM mustard result in numerous adverse impacts. These include health impacts including from the use of chemical herbicides. For instance, glyphosate, a widely used herbicide whose use has increased manifold after glyphosate-tolerant GM crops have been introduced on a large scale in countries like US, Canada, Brazil etc., was classified as a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;probable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;human carcinogen &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;by WHO in early 2015, after decades of claims by promoters that it is a safe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;product. Rapid emergence of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Super-Weeds”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (weeds that cannot be killed by herbicides anymore) has been well documented. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Impacts on non-target organisms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and also on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;soil health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; are well-documented. In countries like India where the largest number of female workers in the economy earn their livelihood mainly by manual de-weeding of “weeds”, use of herbicides and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;HT crops will displace women from their existing livelihood opportunities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; without proper alternatives.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2SbfasCSbnNRjSF-usCy1PBZehJFEpKAFaAqMRDAaUcbUMOsYWOpWOEs0ghln2hltB1YRXJdrkfNoEAyFLnvy7SDjFi__xC1IGUDdZ265CvDBRXGN75DrHXAj72SSBe5ev3OrLxs" alt="" width="166" height="187"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;GM mustard yield increase claims are wrong and unverified&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: There is ample evidence already put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;out in the public domain that the testing of GM mustard was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;deliberately designed to create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;favorable results for DMH-11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, to the point of violating decisions taken by regulators in their&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;meetings, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;violating conditions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; imposed in the permission letter for trials. Convenient protocols were adopted by the applicants to compare GM mustard with very old low yielding varieties, instead of comparing it with other hybrids. They could consequently show that GM mustard yields up to 28 per cent higher than what it has been compared with. It is now well established that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;wrong “Checks”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; were used to make GM mustard look good. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Its yield increase claims can thus be described as rigged and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;wrong.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jF3q7oTTdbGclkKrS874VSBUjUFXK8ft_Hbg2GT7_DMFmm6YKqOhWLzfdz_Ay9q3cUdMiH-ql4pguD7ccsVV0xb2fzXFPTLd--M4Ba1h4O6IG8QlgM1jzqrc2djWv_oSDzzyBB4c" alt="giphy (1).gif" width="480" height="366"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;This GM mustard is a Trojan Horse for other GMOs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: This GM mustard is being pushed by GM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;lobbyists as a public sector GMO to create an aura of acceptability. It is as though when it comes to biosafety, public sector GMOs will automatically become safer than private sector GMOs! Public sector GMOs are in fact as unsafe as private sector GMOs. Moreover, the developers can eventually assign the patents to anyone, including profiteering MNCs. Given huge public opposition to GMOs in our food and farming, it is apparent that corporations like Monsanto which were far ahead in the regulatory pipeline with their products like GM maize have withheld their applications to allow this GM mustard to be approved first on this “public sector” sentiment, so that there is easier entry for all other GMOs in the pipeline.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;India is a Centre of Diversity for Mustard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: As was seen in the case of Brinjal, India happens to be a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Centre of Diversity for Mustard. There are scientists who argue that India is the Centre of Origin too. Starting from the 2004 report of an Agriculture Ministry’s Task Force led by Dr Swaminathan, to the 2013 report of a Supreme Court Technical Expert Committee, there are clear recommendations against genetically modifying those crops for which we are the Centre of Origin/Diversity. This was one of the main reasons for the government’s moratorium on Bt brinjal. GM contamination can destroy the rich genetic heritage of India’s mustard diversity and bring in disastrous monocultures.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	MANILA, Philippines — Greenpeace slapped the National Food Authority (NFA) with a Notice of Violation for allowing the importation and continued sale of genetically-modified rice which, by law, cannot be legally distributed and marketed for human consumption in the country. Serving the notice was a team of Greenpeace GMO Patrol activists who marched to the NFA’s main office in Quezon City to deliver the demand personally to NFA administrator Mr. Jessup Navarro.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greenpeace campaigner, Daniel Ocampo, together with a team of Greenpeace GMO Patrol marches before the entrance of the National Food Authority (NFA) head office moments before Greenpeace slapped the NFA with a Notice of Violation  for allowing the importation and continued sale of genetically-modified rice which, by law, cannot be legally distributed and marketed for human consumption in the country.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the notice, the activists displayed a banner with the
message "Keep our rice GMO free!" to protest the NFA's careless
attitude toward the presence of GMOs (genetically-modified
organisms) in the supply of the country's most important staple
food. Greenpeace also handed the NFA copies of the new Greenpeace
report "Rice Industry in Crisis" outlining the worldwide tide of
opposition to GMO rice, with the world's biggest exporters,
processors, and retailers, issuing written commitments to stay
GMO-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Since last year, Greenpeace has repeatedly alerted the NFA
about the presence in the market of GMO-tainted rice banned for
human consumption. But NFA consistently refused to respond to the
issue. Is the NFA deliberately turning a blind eye to GMO-rice
contamination? Or are they so monumentally inefficient they are
incapable of fulfilling their task of protecting the country's food
supply and the interests of Filipino consumers? The NFA cannot
continue to be silent. Today, we are compelling them to publicly
answer this issue," said Greenpeace Southeast Asia
Genetic-Engineering campaigner Daniel Ocampo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace revealed November last year that an imported US rice
brand, distributed by Purefeeds Corp of Sta. Ana, Manila, "Uncle
Sam Texas Long Grain," was tainted with the GMO Bayer LL601. LL601
is rice genetically altered to resist the powerful herbicide
glufosinate. It is illegal (not approved for distribution or human
consumption) everywhere in the world&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  except in the US where Bayer applied for its marketing
approval only after it massively and illegally contaminated the
global food chain. The LL601 contamination scandal prompted major
rice dealers across the world to commit to GMO-free production and
trade, and has led the EU, Japan, and Russia to stringently test US
rice imports for the GMO-strain to protect their rice markets from
illegal GMO contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Uncle Sam Texas Long Grain" however, continues to be sold in
Philippine supermarkets. The NFA, the state grains trading firm,
aside from being the country's leading rice importer, also oversees
and regulates rice imports of farmers groups and traders. At the
height of the worldwide Bayer LL601 scandal last year, the NFA
issued a statement that they will monitor rice imports from the US
and prevent GMO-tainted varieties from entering the country.
However, the agency ignored the need to monitor GMO-tainted rice
already in Philippine shores. Up until now, the NFA refrains from
commenting and acting on "Uncle Sam Texas Long Grain." Greenpeace
is demanding that the NFA recall the said GMO rice from the market,
and prevent further GMO contamination of the country's staple
food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But the silence may in part be due to the government's
favorable stance toward GMOs. Despite the global movement toward
the rejection of GMO rice, the government is on the brink of
approving an application for the first GMO rice in the Philippine
market. Bayer LL62, also genetically-modified to be herbicide
resistant, might soon be approved for human consumption," said
Ocampo. "But the NFA must keep in mind that the global Bayer
contamination last year proved that GMO rice is risky, causing
massive financial damage to the global rice industry. The
commercial growing of GE rice must never become a reality; or its
impact on the our most important food crop would be
disastrous."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="greenright"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since last year, Greenpeace has repeatedly alerted the NFA
about the presence in the market of GMO-tainted rice banned for
human consumption. But NFA consistently refused to respond to the
issue. Is the NFA deliberately turning a blind eye to GMO-rice
contamination? Or are they so monumentally inefficient they are
incapable of fulfilling their task of protecting the country's food
supply and the interests of Filipino consumers? The NFA cannot
continue to be silent. Today, we are compelling them to publicly
answer this issue."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Ocampo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Southeast Asia Genetic-Engineering campaigner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added: "Along with governments from around the world, the
Philippines must respond to the economic, market and environmental
damage caused by the 2006 GMO rice contamination and reject
outright any GMO rice food and cultivation applications currently
on the table. GMO rice should not be developed as genetic
engineering is an unnecessary, unwanted, and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;outdated technology that threatens the world's most important
staple food."&lt;/p&gt;

	MANILA, Philippines — Greenpeace slapped the National Food Authority (NFA) with a Notice of Violation for allowing the importation and continued sale of genetically-modified rice which, by law, cannot be legally distributed and marketed for human consumption in the country. Serving the notice was a team of Greenpeace GMO Patrol activists who marched to the NFA’s main office in Quezon City to deliver the demand personally to NFA administrator Mr. Jessup Navarro.

<item><subtitle>As India struggles to breathe, over 300 coal power plants are violating air pollution laws and MoEFCC does nothing.</subtitle><tags>fossil fuels</tags><text>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	As of December 7, more than 300 coal power plants across the country are still violating the emission standard norms that were given by the MoEFCC back in 2015. These norms were to come into effect by the 7th of December 2017. But despite being given two years to implement these norms, the Ministry of Power, the Central Electricity Authority, and the power industry, are attempting to push the dates further by 5-7 years until 2022-24 and also relaxing the water usage limits. 

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;MoEFCC’s new norms limited emissions of particulate matter (PM), sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and reduced water usage by coal powered thermal power plants. These emissions are a key contributor to surging particulate matter levels in India, with the coal power sector being a key contributor to air pollution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2017/GP0STRCIW_PressMedia.jpg" alt="Citizen Activists " width="800" height="533"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A group of civil society organisations, volunteers, activists, residents and many other groups representing people across India, gathered outside the Ministry of Environment, Forests &amp;amp; Climate Change on the emission deadline day (D-Day). They reminded the minister of the expiring deadline tonight, the alarming findings of increasing sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions in India since 2012, and claiming their Right to Life &amp;amp; Clean Air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to CPCB, if the new standards are implemented, it will cut down approximately 40% of PM emissions and 48% of both nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide as pollutant from power generation sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following up on Greenpeace India’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Coal Industry's Emission Deadline" href="http://http//www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/cleanairnation/Reports/Out%20of%20Sight.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Out of Sight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; report released in 2016, that had identified air pollution hotspots in India visibly linked to thermal power plants clusters, An updated study identifies that emissions have increased by approximately 32% across the country in the last 5 years as revealed by satellite data. This in a country where people are already struggling for clean air and water security is almost criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Letter to MoEFCC" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Press/Implementation-of-emission-standards-of-thermal-power-plants-must-be-expedited/" target="_blank"&gt;In June 2017&lt;/a&gt;, over 63 signatories from civil society organisations, medical professionals and concerned citizens wrote to the Ministry, urging adherence to the committed deadlines, and released an interim report on the “status of implementation” to dispel rumours about the norms not being met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emphasising the impact on public health due to emissions from sources like the coal-based power plants, the Indian Medical Association Chairman, Dr K K Agrawal said, “As a representative of the medical fraternity, I cannot emphasise enough the necessity of reducing emissions from thermal power plants. Smog is a complex mixture formed by various pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and dust particles, which interact with sunlight to form ground-level ozone, leading to the buildup of haze that hangs in industrial cities. This is a high-alert situation for not only Delhi but villages and towns near these plants as well, with children and older adults at high risk. Those with lung disorders and breathing issues are also highly vulnerable to the ill effects of this condition. Air pollution is responsible for premature deaths in Delhi and across the country. Its repercussions may not be immediately obvious but the long-term implications of air pollution are fatal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="report" href="https://umdrightnow.umd.edu/news/umd-led-study-indicates-india-replacing-china-world%E2%80%99s-top-source-sulfur-dioxide-air-pollution" target="_blank"&gt;India has surpassed China’s SO2 emission&lt;/a&gt; and now has the dubious distinction of being the world’s largest emitter of SO2, a major toxic pollutant that has a serious impact on human health. The ultimate win for air quality improvement can only be achieved as the result of coordinated, multi-pollutant emission reductions. With each passing day of non-compliance of these emission standards, the health of millions of Indians is increasingly at risk. The Ministry needs to come up immediately with strict, implementable deadlines and a concrete roadmap for each plant to ensure compliance. This should be made available on public platforms for close monitoring by various stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><subtitle>Human casualties have increased eight times in state since 2005</subtitle><tags>forest</tags><text>&lt;h2&gt;Human casualties have increased eight times in state since 2005&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	October 7, 2014, Raipur: Human-elephant conflicts in Chhattisgarh have increased many folds, according to a report released by Greenpeace India. Yet, the state government seems more keen on mining in the forests than notifying the proposed Lemru Elephant Reserve or taking any concrete steps to manage the conflict despite warnings and protests.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Elephant population in Chhattisgarh has grown since the pachyderms started visiting the state's forests in late '80s due to rampant deforestation in Odisha and Jharkhand. This has resulted in an increase in human-elephant conflict causing damages to human life, animals and property. Human deaths due to elephant attacks have also increased eight times, to an average of 25 deaths a year since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report 'Elephant in the Room' (1) studies the human-elephant conflicts in four thriving forest divisions of Chhattisgarh - South Sarguja, Katghora, Korba and Dharamjaigarh in which two coal fields, Hasdeo Arand and Mandraigarh, are located. The study takes an inclusive look at the current issues within these four forest divisions where coal mining is proposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the report, around 14 elephants have died due to electrocution in Chhattisgarh between 2005 and 2013. Human-elephant conflict has also caused 198 human deaths here in the same period. The state recorded 8,657 incidents of property damages and 99,152 incidents of crop damage between 2004 and 2014. Total compensation paid towards human-elephant conflict has amounted to Rs. 2,140.20 lakh during this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, elephant presence was recorded in most of the coal blocks in the study area, where the government has identified sites for mining. These forest divisions already account for an average of more than 30% human death and crop damage incidents of the state. Hence, further diversion of forests here could lead to an increase in the existing human-elephant conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Campaigner and the lead author of the report, Nandikesh Shivalingam, said, "Despite glaring evidence of elephant presence in these forest divisions and advice from expert bodies to protect Korba and Dharamjaigarh forests, the state has dropped the proposed Lemru elephant reserve, possibly due to mining interests. These forests are home not just to elephants but also leopards and sloth bears, and may be even tigers. It was ironical that the state dropped the Lemru reserve after obtaining all permissions from the Centre in 2007."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pointing to this irony, Goldman Environment Prize winning activist Ramesh Agarwal, said,&lt;br&gt;"The state's proposal to confining the elephants within protected areas far away from these forests is clearly not the solution. Elephants have started residing and breeding in the forests of Chhattisgarh. The state should stop providing shallow solutions that do not address the real issue. This is costing the state a colossal loss of human and elephant lives, as well as wasting public money. Hence, there is a need for a comprehensive plan to save the wildlife and the people of the state."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court cancelled the licences of 214 coal blocks terming the allocations as illegal. Stating that the recent judgment was heartening to activists and their long fight to save the Indian forests, Mr. Shivalingam said, "Government has got yet another opportunity to correct the wrongs. We now urge the Centre and the state government to avoid auctioning within the forests and setup an independent committee to study the elephant movements in the state to manage the human-wildlife conflict more effectively."&lt;/p&gt;

<item><subtitle>Bangalore join hands with the global movement against Monsanto and GMO’s</subtitle><tags>health</tags><text>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	On the eve of the World Food Day on October 15, Bangaloreans joined the global march against Monsanto for the cause of food safety and seed sovereignty in India. Almost 200 people including farmers, scientists, students and activists gathered in front of the Town Hall in the heart of the city and proclaimed their rejection of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in our food and farming and corporate control over our agriculture.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The gathering raised slogans against Genetically Modified (GM) crops and Monsanto and sang songs about the need for ecological farming. 'Monsanto go back' was a strong sentiment throughout the event and people of all ages echoed this call. Activists also performed a short street play to depict the dangers of GMO's and corporatisation of our food systems. Several activists also spoke about the current scenario with GMO's in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inaugurating the public action against Monsanto, veteran freedom fighter and Gandhian, H.S Doraiswamy urged everybody to continue the struggle to keep our food and farming free from the clutches of profit hungry multinationals like Monsanto. Reminding the gathering about our freedom movement he said, "The very cotton that Gandhiji used as a weapon for our freedom struggle against the British Raj is now totally under the control of an American multinational, Monsanto. This they did through aggressive marketing tactics of their proprietary GM Bt cotton, the only GM crop commercially cultivated in our country. After gaining total control over cotton seeds they are now aiming to get control over our food crops and that needs to be stopped at any cost."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Currently Monsanto controls 95 % of the cotton seeds in India. Their Bt cotton has failed miserably and farmer suicides have increased in regions like Maharashtra were Bt cotton was introduced. Highlighting it's massive failure in Karnataka Anekatti Vishwanath, farmer leader from Dodballapur near Bangalore said, "The Bt cotton myth has been broken. It has neither increased the yields nor has it brought down the pesticide use. All that it has done is to give the entire cotton seed market into the hands of Monsanto which has earned hundreds of crores as royalties from our farmers. The tragedy is that our own government and public sector agriculture institutions are hand in glow in this fraud."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further demanded the state government to immediately conduct an investigation into the failure of Bt cotton in the state and blacklist companies like Monsanto who have caused severe distress to poor farmers in Karnataka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 11th October 2013, the Karnataka High Court had dismissed petitions that challenged criminal prosecution of top officials of Monsanto/Mahyco and University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharward who have been accused of the egregious crime of biopiracy in promotion of Bt Brinjal, India's first GM food crop. Speaking from the event, Leo Saldanha from the Environment Support Group (ESG) which first exposed this serious crime said, "Monsanto has historically worked to take away control over seeds from local farming communities as an integral part of their business model. Now they have been caught red handed illegally appropriating brinjal varieties endemic to India and which constitute our biodiversity heritage. We will continue to closely monitor efforts of national and state biopiracy regulatory agencies to ensure the criminal proceedings against the corporation and collaborating institutions reaches its logical end."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the world, Monsanto has been removed and banned from several countries like Germany, Russia, Japan, New Zealand, France, Switzerland etc.In India, Monsanto is still vying to get complete control over our seeds and farming to maximise their profits. Neha Saigal, Sustainable Agriculture campaigner, Greenpeace India, says, "On the one hand scientific evidence on adverse impacts of GM crops on human health, environment and farm livelihoods are increasing by the day and on the other hand our central government is out on a limb to push GM crops into our farms and plates. The latest in these efforts is the Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India (BRAI) Bill which has been introduced in the last session of the parliament. The bill proposes to create a single window clearance system which is designed for easy approval of GM crops. This is nothing but a Monsanto protection and Promotion law."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is imperative that the BRAI bill is withdrawn because it will facilitate the fast track entry of GM food crops into our agriculture and lower the bar for GM crop approvals with no independent long-term studies on their safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of this year's World Food Day is 'Sustainable Food systems for food security and Nutrition'. Let's not forget that we cannot afford to leave our health and the safety of the food we eat to corporations whose only driving force is growth and profit. Sustainable agriculture can create enough healthy food for our population while also safeguarding the environment and our farmer's livelihoods. Until the government promotes sustainable agriculture over dangerous technologies like GM crops it is our responsibility to protest all across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

	On the eve of the World Food Day on October 15, Bangaloreans joined the global march against Monsanto for the cause of food safety and seed sovereignty in India. Almost 200 people including farmers, scientists, students and activists gathered in front of the Town Hall in the heart of the city and proclaimed their rejection of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in our food and farming and corporate control over our agriculture.

	47 million children worst affected: Airpocalypse II, Greenpeace India report
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Delhi, 29 January 2018&lt;/strong&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2018/Airpocalypse_II_29Jan18.pdf"&gt;Airpocalypse-II&lt;/a&gt;, a Greenpeace India report released on Monday, analyses PM10 annual average recorded for 280 cities which have 630 million, or 53% citizens of the country’s total population. A massive part of the population, 580 million (47%) of the population are living in areas where no air quality data is available. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Out of 630 million close to 550 million people live in areas exceeding national standards for PM10, including 180 million living in areas where air pollution levels are more than twice the stipulated limit of 60g/m3which has been set by Central Pollution Control Board.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2018/Airpocalypse_II_29Jan18.pdf"&gt;The report&lt;/a&gt; highlights that as many as 47 million children under the age of five years are residing in areas where PM10 levels exceeded CPCB annual limits, including 17 million children under the age of five who are in the areas where pollution levels are more than twice the limits. Children are worst affected in states such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, Maharashtra and Delhi respectively. Together these states are home to 12.9 million children who are below or upto five years of age trapped in bad air exceeding by more than twice the annual standard.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sunil Dahiya, Senior Campaigner, Greenpeace India said:  “Only 16% of the population inhabiting the districts have real time air quality data available portrays how in-humanly we are responding to the national health crises in front of us. Even the manual data collected for 300 cities/towns across the country is not shared in a timely manner and in a format which can be accessed and understood easily by general public.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ranking of cities based on annual average of PM10 levels reveals- Delhi as the worst polluted city with 290 μg/m3 followed by Faridabad, Bhiwadi, Patna with annual average ranging from 272 μg/m3, 262 μg/m3 &amp;amp; 261 μg/m3 respectively. Surprisingly, Dehradun in Uttrakhand, once thought to be a salubrious preserve of retiring elite, also made it to the top 10 list of worst polluted cities with 238 μg/m3 annual average of PM10. The annual average of PM10 levels for the top 20 most polluted cities are between 290 μg/m3 and 195 μg/m3,for the year 2016. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dahiya further added “Delhi remained the worst impacted city with annual PM10 levels exceeding approximately 5 times the national ambient air quality standards. The fact that less than 20% Indian cities are complying with the national, or CPCB, standards sadly points to the lack of workable, robust and timely action plans so far.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2018/Airpocalypse_II_29Jan18.pdf"&gt;The report&lt;/a&gt; adds that most polluted cities are spread across the Indo-Gangetic basin with southern cities being slightly better off than their northern counterparts. However, cities in south also need focused and time bound action plan to bring air quality to achieve the WHO standards showing a pathway for other cities across India. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://pib.nic.in/newsite/mbErel.aspx?relid=175437"&gt;The National Clean Air Programme&lt;/a&gt; recently announced by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change firstly needs to be comprehensive, systematic and time bound plans with fixed accountabilities and secondly it needs to be made public soon for it to come into action, which will also help in having active participation of the general public and all layers of the government to take the idea to the ground level along with tackling myriad sources of pollution daunting the quality of air through vast parts of the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Footnote: The report analysed data obtained from National Air Monitoring Programme, RTI responses from State Pollution Control Boards and annual reports along with websites of various State Pollution Control Boards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Way Forward Suggested in Airpocalypse Report Part-II&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institute robust monitoring mechanism of air quality across the country,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real time data sharing for data from Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring System (CAAQS) and near real-time data sharing for manual stations with public on various platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health advisory and ‘red alerts’ for bad-air days in order to alert public to take precautionary steps to protect their health and the environment and directions to the industries to reduce their pollution emission load.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measures like shutting down schools, reduction of traffic, shutting down power plants and industries etc should automatically come into force as soon as air quality deteriorates beyond a specified level and takes alarming proportions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of data as a basis to fine tune pollution reduction strategies that must, inter alia, seek to improve public transport and reduce use of fossil fuel by vehicles, generators and water pump sets that are commonly used by cultivators in the farm sector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stricter enforcement of laws to take polluting vehicles off the roads. Introduction of higher fuel standards like Bharat VI for motor vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforcement of stiff emission regulations and improved efficiency for thermal power plants and industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moving from diesel generators to rooftop solar power backup and increased use of clean renewable energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incentivising use of electric vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dust removal from roads or covering pavement by green cover and regulation of construction activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ban on waste burning and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find sustainable alternatives to the biomass burning as soon as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;These strategies should be formalised into a time bound action plan with clearly defined targets and penalties in case of non-compliance so as to ensure accountability. While some actions might need to be city or region-specific, these ought to be a part of a broad range of nationally applicable actions with active public participation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Airpocalypse II Video Link- &lt;a href="http://media.greenpeace.org/archive/Airpocalypse-II--A-Report-on-Air-Pollution-Across-Indian-Cities-27MZIFJXE65K0.html"&gt;http://bit.ly/2DXZFK8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Airpocalypse II Report Link- &lt;a href="~/link/af31a067083945f4ade5630b9c6d65a2.pdf"&gt;www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2018/Airpocalypse_II_29Jan18.pdf &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photo Link- &lt;a href="http://media.greenpeace.org/C.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&amp;amp;LBID=27MZKTNFG3AE0&amp;amp;IT=Thumb_FixedHeight_M_Details_NoToolTip"&gt;http://bit.ly/2BA1rfu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;         &lt;br&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;For Further details-&lt;br&gt;Madhulika Verma; Sr. Media Specialist &lt;img class="obfimg Eoi_1" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Templates/Planet3/Styles/Images/emailimages/dfcc049ef56078a7b5a187df9e2af3f9.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suno #KediakiKahaan, Volunteers ki Zubaani&lt;/em&gt; (Listen to Kedia's story through the volunteers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 3 years, I’ve been working with Greenpeace volunteers in Delhi. I also get lucky sometimes and get to work volunteers in other parts of the country. They may come from different cities and backgrounds, but they all have atleast one thing in common- the Greenpeace core values and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unbreakable spirit has driven twenty four inspiring volunteers from all parts of the country to come to a small village in Bihar called Kedia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/8/535508/129271_225567.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My colleagues on ground await our volunteers eagerly! Pic Credits: Chaittanya Kumar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their journey may have taken 51 hours to reach there, they may speak multiple tongues and have different life experiences- but they all realize that there is something else which connects all of them apart from Greenpeace- food. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is with this realization that they’re here to bear witness to Kedia’s amazing transition from chemical dependant farming, to ecological practices which do not harm the bio-diversity and soil health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting today, twenty four volunteers from all across the country have embarked on a journey for week long volunteer camp along with the 99 farmer families of Kedia. The ultimate ambition of this camp is to get ecological agriculture to the city, and the city to ecological agriculture. These Food for Life change-makers will be working with famers to learn various Eco-Ag practices, encouraging public participation on the issue of chemical-dependant farming and learning methods to mitigate that, and get trained in tools which will help them exercise their citizen muscle back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming week, they will show us what we in the cities ought to learn about our food, farming and farmers and how it is possible for all of us to get involved in India’s Eco-Agriculture movement. If I can give you a hint, the answer lies right in our plates... and waste-bins. Watch out for #KediakiKahaani &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustaining with solar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental conservation and protection are the foundation stones of environmentalists and environmental organizations. Preaching and practicing measures that will uphold these beliefs are a day-to-day affair. Greenpeace, an environmental NGO, is no stranger to this. All our global offices, including the Indian office makes sure that our efficiency and energy savings are best in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been established in India since 2002 and since that time, we have been quite stringent about our e-waste and recycling policy and this has been welcomed genuinely by our peers and supporters. Taking our commitment to the next level, we came up with an initiative to make our office space (a four-storey building) a complete Green building. We retro-fitted all our lights with highly efficient LED’s and other appliances like fans, air-conditioners, etc. with five-star rated, low energy consumption products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with this and a complete energy audit of the building, we decided to install a 18 kW solar PV system on our roof, which will be generating close to 80% of our daily energy needs. This project was a very important initiative and we had to make sure it was not only successful, but also effective economically. Considering a payback period of close to 7 years, this project was given a go ahead 3 years back, and for the last 2 years we have been successfully harnessing the power of the sun, effectively being used by close to 150 people in the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system we have adopted is more of a two-way grid tied system which is directly connected to the grid. So in the morning hours we directly use the energy from the panels and once the energy drops post 5 p.m. the grid supply kicks in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also happens on cloudy and rainy days when we completely run on the grid. This system has also made us more intuitively responsible in consuming electricity in a smart manner and helped us reduce wastage. We also advocate and urge all our staff members and supporters to go solar in their homes as the state gives a lot of subsidy. The technicalities of installation are much similar and smaller in scale when one decides to put up a 1-3 kW rooftop system at their home. At present many states in the country have enabling policies that support rooftop solar programs, the most recent one being Delhi, which was achieved after a year-long public and political campaign by Greenpeace India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With favorable policies in many states and presence of abundant sunshine, it’s never too late to go solar. "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;"Going solar in our cities will reduce the overall power demand close to 40% both from the residential and industrial sectors. Similarly, solar can address effectively the energy access issues present largely in rural India."&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such effective example, is the solar microgird &lt;strong&gt;set up in &lt;a href="http://dharnailive.org/"&gt;Dharnai &lt;/a&gt; by Greenpeace&lt;/strong&gt; which powers the aspirations of people and provides them with 24/7 electricity which they never had in the last 35 years. It’s imperative that such models are adopted on a large scale to provide people with access to energy, then and there, in a timely and efficient manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban solutions and rural solutions are parallel pathways that need to coexist in today’s development pathway with increasing demand for energy. At the end of the day, it’s not about how much we consume, but how much we effectively save. After all, energy is also a natural resource.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Thermal power plants are one of the major causes of air pollution in the country, especially in the Indo Gangetic Plain region (IGP). In December 2015, the Indian Government came out with a strict emission notification to control emissions from thermal power plants. According to the rules, all power plants are required to install emission control equipments by the end of 2017. Reports indicate that, most power plants are yet to take the basic steps towards complying with the new rules even after 15 months since the notification was issued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The most recent negotiations within the government body is one that’s intending to dilute the very rules that were put in place for the protection of public health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Power plant emitting toxic fumes" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/134416_238614.jpg" alt="Power plant emitting toxic fumes"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power plant showing the release of toxic emissions&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://cpcb.nic.in/Delhi.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;According to the CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board)&lt;/a&gt;, almost four-fifth of the nitrogen dioxide and 95% of the sulphur dioxide in Delhi’s air originates from power plants (especially the Badarpur power plant as it is thelargest source within the boundaries of Delhi) and industries. Despite recognising this, the MoEFCC (Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change) the highest authority, has failed to enforce emission standards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While on the one hand, the government has acknowledged the grave pollution that thermal power plants are causing, there is reluctance in implementing its own rules (emission standards) for all coal based power plants across India. Is this a show of mere tokenism by the government to its own emission standards, by shutting down just one thermal power plant when more than a hundred of the remaining power plants continue to pollute our air?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Greenpeace analysis of &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Press/Out-of-Sight-/" target="_blank"&gt;NASA’s satellite data &lt;/a&gt;found out that coal-based thermal power plants were the largest source of SO2 and NOx emissions in North India (including Delhi) in 2016. These particles have the ability to get transformed into microscopic particles once emitted into the atmosphere and hence stands to reason why they are the main culprits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indo-Gangetic plain has thus far had the largest number of human beings exposed to severe air pollution episodes due to the highly polluting thermal power plants in the region- causing some of the worst health impacts than anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the data obtained by Greenpeace India through RTIs, the Badarpur power plant has been significantly exceeding the emission standards notified for new thermal power plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Badarpur plant’s emission rates would not be legal in any other major economy, and it is a fact. Take for instance China, all operating power plants, no matter how old, had to cut their emissions about three to four times as much as Badarpur’s emission rates, by July 2014. In another case, the European Union passed a requirement for all operating power plants to cut their particle emissions to one sixth of Badarpur's rates by early last year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it's not just Badarpur either, according to our mapping, there are a total of 15 large coal-based power plants within 300 km of Delhi with a total capacity of almost 18,000 MW (close to 50 times Badarpur's operating capacity). None of these power plants have still been equipped with the modern emission control systems that many other major economies have made a routine requirement for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is obvious from the recent setbacks is that the government seems to be interested in concerns raised by polluting industries more than ordinary citizens suffering in smog.&lt;br&gt;The justification behind the delay in the implementation of emission standards, according to Mr.Piyush Goyal, the power minister, is the high tariff cost involved with importing emission control equipments. Despite an estimated  3% loss of India's GDP due to air pollution every year, it's quite unfortunate that this issue is seen through the narrow lense of economics and not in the context of protecting public health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the government balks at requiring a few hundred power plants to install rudimentary emission controls, how can thousands of farms or crores of motorists be expected to  accept new regulations? And how can the nation’s power industry get fixing, if addressing an issue at one power plant in the nation’s capital proves too much?&lt;/p&gt;

	It’s been precisely one year now, since 2000 citizens of Dharnai, a small village near Bodhgaya in the eastern Indian state of Bihar &lt;a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.in/first-fully-solar-powered-village-india-dharnais-story-begins-after-33-years-darkness-video-605261"&gt;achieved access to electricity&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in 30 years. To most us who are living in this digital era, even an hour of power outage can ruin the entire day. So to imagine an entire generation that had not seen the glow of a light bulb is mind boggling.

&lt;span&gt;Our work on solutions campaigns in India spans a decade; from “Choose Positive Energy” in Orissa in 2005, to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://act.greenpeace.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1862&amp;amp;ea.campaign.id=38722&amp;amp;ea.tracking.id=cch_et_fbps&amp;amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_term=solar%20street%20lights&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Climate&amp;amp;__surl__=IgDjC&amp;amp;__ots__=1437378547287&amp;amp;__step__=1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Switch on the Sun”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in Delhi today. We started our work in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/publications/Empowering-Bihar/"&gt;&lt;span&gt; Bihar in 2010 with the Urja Kranti Yatra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, urging political parties in Bihar to look towards &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Climate-Reports/Energy-Revolution-2012/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Decentralized Renewable energy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; solutions, in order to empower people in the state with energy access at par with the rest of the country.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Last year,on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/Dharnai-Live/blog/49962/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;20th July 2014, when Dharnai came live&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, it was the first milestone towards a great vision of autonomous energy access for the state and the country. I was present at the launch of the micro-grid, and it was a moment when people’s lives changed from darkness to light. In such rural areas the lack of access to modern energy services further turns into the absence of basic facilities, like sanitation and health care into pressing problems.There are well-documented studies of women who walk miles to collect water or fuel, or have to relieve themselves outdoors without toilets, where trying to access to basic facilities turn into harassment or worse.&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;In contrast, the lives of women in Dharnai changed drastically with the advent of the micro-grid. Not only did access to energy act as a catalyst that drives other socio-economic improvements, but lighting up a village like Dharnai created opportunities for women and girls by increasing access to both public and personal spaces after dark. Children studied late into the night, and women no longer needed to finish preparing meals before the sun set. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt; &lt;iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/101174682" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Streets could be accessed at night, and make-shift shops sprung up underneath the streetlights. It made the whole community safer. Now in Dharnai, there are 60 solar based streetlights that light up the four hamlets and thereby reassuring the safety and increasing productivity of the villagers as well.  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Soon after the inauguration last year, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Multimedia1/Videos/Nitish-Kumar-visits-solar-village-of-Dharnai/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chief Minister Nitish Kumar visited the village&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and acknowledged that the Dharnai model is the future of energy supply to those 2000 people present and to the whole world that was watching. This validation from the head of the state was the most ambitious moment for this village micro grid. For over 30 years, high-tension electric wires have passed by the village without lighting up a single home inside it, and this is also the grim reality of most  villages in Bihar. The concept of a centralized grid seems perfect when you live in Delhi or Mumbai, but reality kicks in when you step into these forsaken villages plunged into darkness after dusk. The main problem lies with the defunct central grid infrastructure followed by  wrong prioritization of the electricity supply that ends up in villages like Dharnai. Even with a large capacity additions of centralized solar PV farms, the situation will remain bleak. The efficiency of solar PV coupled with the poor grid efficiency will result only in inferior quality of electricity and will blemish the trust on renewables altogether. The last mile connectivity of the villages can only be achieved efficiently by micro-grids based on renewables.&lt;/span&gt;
Today after a successful one year, I wish there would be more success stories like Dharnai where people and energy are connected and government’s envision a more sustainable pathway to our future.Like the roads of Dharani that are lit up through solar based lighting, I would like to see the Dark corners in Delhi and the proposed 100 Smart cities to be lit up on Solar Street Lights for safer and smarter cities. And for this we need your support, sign &lt;a href="http://grnpc.org/IgDjC"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's day thirteen. Another relaxed day in Junglistan, my first and the last visitors for the day were a couple of Western coal field employees who landed up at 8:30 am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them was the contractor who was responsible for diverting the little stream that flows past my tree house towards the coal mine so that the river can become the carrier of dirty water that flows from the coal mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was boasting about this great idea he had to divert the natural flow of the stream, which goes around the periphery of the forest to make it go through a few villages. I don’t really know why he wanted to do that. He said he supported what I was doing, said forests need to be saved and then around 9:15 rushed to the coal mines as his shift was about to begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I'll leave you with some new sights from Junglistan.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span&gt;How many times must civil society organisations, residents and children, pay a visit to the Environment Ministry of India until something is actually “done” about the air pollution crisis? As a country, we’ve already seen more than a million deaths as a result of outdoor air pollution and it has even cost our economy. &lt;strong&gt;Today, as the long term action plan for Delhi-NCR continues to be in the “discussion” phase, the rest of the country has been virtually left out in the cold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img title="Children visit the Environment Ministry of India" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/141083_254766.jpg" alt="Children visit the Environment Ministry of India"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what is the problem? &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;span&gt;If you believe that continuous air quality monitoring stations will help people take informed decisions on polluted days, then the news as per Airpocalypse II is that, real-time monitoring stations have almost doubled across the country in the last couple of years. However, there is still a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;significant lack of data in 23 states&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and the lack of access to captured data in many cities. Such a lack of data has also reflected in regulatory decision making for sourcewise emissions. Some decisions including old and polluting power plants and vehicles that have not been shut down on time, efficiency of thermal power plants that have not been improved, and biomass burning - has still not been regulated. When comparing China's  robust network of 1500+ stations and a transparent public sharing platform, I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ndia has only 87 continuous monitoring stations across - a condition that needs to change sooner than later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img title="Taj Mahal smothered in smog" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/133599_236599.jpg" alt="Taj Mahal smothered in smog"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Comparison of facts on air pollution around the world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Promotion of province governors depends on meeting targets
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888;"&gt;
States must adopt emission reduction measures into law that are demonstrated to enable meeting targets; must account for pollution transport into downwind states; periodic review
&lt;/td&gt;

Cities &amp;amp; countries face legal action for not meeting standards

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So then, what does the available and accessible data point to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br class="kix-line-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;An 80% of the 228 cities that have data for particulate matter 10 (PM10) pollutants - violate annual safe limits of 60μg/m³ (not so safe when compared to WHO standards- 20μg/m³). As of now, 18 crore Indians, including 1.7 crore children under the age of 5, live in areas where the air pollution levels are more than twice the prescribed clean air standards. Many of these critically polluted cities point to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;need for strict emergency response plans for sourcewise release of pollutants - that are more immediate, short-term and time bound. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;We can beat airpocalypse only if pollution levels are assessed widely and regularly and if there are clear reduction targets for regions, along with penalties for any non-compliance by governments and corporations. Clean air in India can only be a reality if the government understands that the air pollution crisis is not just centered to Delhi-NCR, but all of India, and if we as the public - choose to move towards solar rooftops, energy efficient appliances that can reduce household energy usage, public transport, cycling and walking, and reducing waste generated at our own houses - thereby reducing burning of waste at streets and landfills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img title="Indians solarise" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/136622_243966.jpg" alt="Indians solarise"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s time to buckle down and get cracking on the already formulated National Clean Air Programme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/page/19095/action/1?utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_source=website&amp;amp;utm_campaign=airpollution&amp;amp;utm_content=the-indian-airpocalypse" target="_blank"&gt;Sign up and own a digital copy of the second edition of the Airpocalypse report.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/page/19095/action/1?utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_source=website&amp;amp;utm_campaign=airpollution&amp;amp;utm_content=the-indian-airpocalypse" target="_blank"&gt;Find out what the report says about your state/city today. &lt;/a&gt;

	A report released by Greenpeace India earlier this week, on Monday, points to the scary and abnormally high levels of air pollution in UP. 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucknow | 3 February 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; Environment protection organisations Greenpeace India, Go Green and The Climate Agenda joined other civil society groups to organise a symposium on air pollution. The participants in the symposium held on Saturday at Sheroes Café in Lucknow’s Gomti Nagar highlighted and stressed the need for a regional action plan for the improvement of air quality in pollution-ridden Uttar Pradesh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A report released by Greenpeace India earlier this week, on Monday, points to the scary and abnormally high levels of air pollution in UP. The report called Airpocalypse-II collates and highlights particulate matter, or PM10, levels data for the air of 280 Indian cities for the year 2015 and 2016. As per the report which is now in its second edition as many as 15 cities of UP turn out to be among 30 most polluted cities of the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Senior Greenpeace campaigner Sunil Dahiya told the gathering in Lucknow that “the situation of air in UP’s environs is most worrisome. No less than 53 districts in the province are still without any monitoring mechanism of air quality. And in the rest of the 22 cities where air quality data is available none meet or conform to the national air quality standards.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Famed social worker Tahira Hasan shared her ideas about raising the levels of public awareness in the wake of rapidly growing air pollution and to fight it out through a vibrant people’s movement. She said, “We will have to go to the schools, colleges and various localities and spread awareness. We must realise this, that a safe and healthy environment is essential for a socially just development model.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The head of Lucknow University’s Department of Journalism Mukul Srivastava made important points saying, “We need to rethink our idea of development. Being a true nationalist means saving the country’s air and environment. Today, to save the country, we need to save the environment.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To enliven the spirit for environmental protection and improving the quality of air that people cutting across class, caste and creed breathe a musical performance marked by soulful songs was held alongside the symposium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those attending the Saturday’s event felt that the air pollution has attained the levels of a national health crisis which is now from the point of view of Uttar Pradesh is becoming as or even more serious as is the case with Delhi. And to take on this all sections of the society and the government should come together and demand and devise a comprehensive, systematic and time bound action plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Further Details; please contact-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Sunil Dahiya, Senior Campaigner, Greenpeace India; &lt;img class="obfimg Eoi_1" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Templates/Planet3/Styles/Images/emailimages/e826c1965cddb8a77b7f3ffc9898e677.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common assumption that one would have about a green space such as a park or a lake-side trail is that it is free from pollution and contamination.  Many look at these spaces as tranquil hubs for rejuvenation and fresh air. These are in other words considered as safe havens away from the hustle and bustle of the city life. Delhi has many such parks and historical settings to offer. And, Lodhi Garden, located in one of the prime areas in Delhi, the Lodhi Road, is known for its clean and green placid setting. The garden appeals to a wide variety of people including that of the fitness enthusiasts, picnic lovers and tourists. Despite the soaring air pollution levels in the city, one would expect the air to be cleaner and healthier while in a park or a garden. &lt;em&gt;However, sadly, there seems to be no escape from the toxic air pollution levels for Delhiites even when inside a green setting.&lt;/em&gt; A quick, half-hour long air pollution check done by Greenpeace inside the Lodhi Garden revealed an alarmingly high amount of pollution in the air. The PM2.5 levels were found to be three times that of the Indian safety limits and 9 times that of the WHO’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s what the morning walkers at the Lodhi Garden had to say about the city’s pollution levels –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interaction with a morning-walkers club at Lodhi Garden &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Group of morning walkers look at instant air pollution readings conducted in the morning at Lodhi gardens, New Delhi. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A group of ten men past the age of 50 had a lot to say about the city’s piteous air quality. They call themselves the Lodhi Garden club and all of them have been living in Delhi throughout their lives and have seen the city’s air quality degrade over a period of time. Most of them think it is severely polluted and uninhabitable! They revealed that they try and avoid being in Delhi as far as possible and constantly look for weekend getaways in search of fresh air. They also informed us that they had installed air purifiers in most of the rooms in their houses in order to reduce the harmful effects of pollution. However, they were under the impression that Lodhi Garden would reduce their exposure to the air pollution levels and have expressed shock upon learning our findings. One of the walkers also opined that there are no measures to control pollution levels whatsoever and that the most important thing to notice is that the younger generation will suffer the most because of pollution. “There’s no future for you all in this kind of pollution levels” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A morning walker and a naturopath shared her observation of an exponential increase in the number of asthma cases in the last few years and that most of her patients suffered from chronic bronchial ailments. She has also disclosed that she suffers from eye irritation and eye watering due to the pollution in the air. Our findings on air pollution levels inside Lodhi Garden left her flabbergasted! She feels that there’s an immediate need to curb the air pollution levels in the city as it can worsen respiratory ailments and cause serious damage to people’s health. She also felt that the city as a whole, along with the Govt needs to proactively participate by making a conscious choice to use the public transport systems that can help reduce the pollution levels. &lt;/p&gt;

<item><subtitle>Greenpeace celebrates farmers’ securing independence through ecological agriculture</subtitle><tags>sustainable agriculture</tags><text>&lt;h2&gt;Greenpeace celebrates farmers’ securing independence through ecological agriculture&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	Patna 13th August:  Greenpeace volunteers celebrated alongside farmers in Kedia, as the Bihar Labour Resources Minister Vijay Prakash inaugurated the state’s first ever solar powered cold storage in Kedia, Jamui on Saturday. 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Kedia’s farmers have become an example for farmers across India [1] by their sustained efforts towards ecological farming. The installation of a crowd-funded, solar-powered, cold storage facility is a landmark achievement for this heroic community, and marks the beginning of a new chapter in the success of ‘The Kedia Model.’ &lt;strong&gt;(Footnote 1)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“As India approaches its 69th Independence Day, we celebrate together a new, meaningful freedom in Kedia,” said Ishteyaque Ahmed, Greenpeace Campaigner, “Kedia is celebrating freedom from harmful agro-chemicals, freedom from the crippling debts incurred due to high input costs, and dependence on an unstable, exploitative market, and relative freedom from erratic climate conditions that see so much food going to waste.” &lt;strong&gt;(Footnote 2)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The installation of the Eco-frost cold storage comes as a boon to the farmers of this small village. Besides being environment-friendly, the solar-powered freezer will help farmers resist the pressure to sell their produce at exploitative prices. By providing a way to extend the shelf-life of their produce, the freezer gives farmers a degree of control over fluctuating market conditions, so that they can secure better prices and higher returns for their products. By enabling the safe storage of their seeds for future harvests as well, the facility provides the farmers financial security, and greater control over their futures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunita Devi, one of Kedia’s progressive farmers, says, &lt;em&gt;“Until now we couldn’t afford to grow vegetables commercially, because the lack of storage facilities meant that they would start to rot before we could sell them profitably. Now, the cold storage will ensure less wastage of our produce, and allow us to grow vegetables that can fetch us about Rs 500 a day.”&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought through individual donations secured via a Greenpeace-managed crowdfunding campaign, the eco-frost facility is a functional reminder of the colossal support Kedia has received from people across India. A number of Bollywood celebrities joined in, urging their fans to raise &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8mKnkMnZVU" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DM8mKnkMnZVU&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1471179691152000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEjDKTY3msJH3Y5EZ022AcNSiYvEw"&gt;#Support4Farmers.&lt;/a&gt; The initiative caught the imagination of citizens in far-off cities, reflecting their aspiration for a future free of toxics in their food, and their empathy for the current plight of small farmers in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging the unconditional support and encouragement from local administration, government schemes and people of Kedia, Greenpeace Campaigner Ishteyaque Ahmed says&lt;em&gt;, “In less than two years the perseverance shown by the farmers has resulted in the successful creation of the Kedia model. This model can easily be replicated all over the country and has the potential to bring a paradigm shift in Indian agriculture.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes to the Editor:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;[1] Kedia’s farmers are trying to set an example for the rest of the farming communities across India: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since 2014, Kedia has witnessed 42.6% reduction in chemical fertiliser usage and 100% respite from hazardous pesticide affecting yield and soil health.” - &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/publications/Bihar-Living-Soils-Project/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/publications/Bihar-Living-Soils-Project/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1471179691153000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFRq816jZs_i6Quaob4Tgwif4OIyw"&gt;&lt;span&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/publications/Bihar-Living-Soils-Project/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;When a government body excludes all the farmers' and consumers' voice to decide on pushing a highly debated technology into their farm and food, it's time for the alarm bells to ring in a democracy. Specially when independent scientists raise concern, farmer unions protest and consumers say no to GM crops very vocally. The major mustard producing states have clearly opposed GM Mustard. For whose benefit are these people taking decisions in closed room are working for?&lt;img title="GM Mustard protest outside Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/122460_209433.jpg" alt="Activists protest against the potential approval of GM Mustard outside Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Activists protest against the potential approval of GM Mustard outside Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM Mustard is a herbicide tolerant hybrid that is resistant to Glufosinate, a toxic herbicide, which will dramatically increase the presence of toxic chemicals in our food. The farmers will have to pay higher price for the seeds. We Indians will be eating the leaves and the seeds alike of a plant that has been genetically mutated. All this when ecological solutions have shown higher levels of productivity and resilience which is good for environment, farmers, people but of course not for seeds and chemical producing companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="GM Mustard " src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/122462_209436.jpg" alt="Rally outside Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change to oppose GM Mustard "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rally against genetically modified Mustard in New Delhi held on 5th February 2016 outside Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the banner of Sarson Satyagraha, a group of farmer organizations and concerned citizens working to protect our Mustard from genetic contamination gathered on 5th February in front of Pariyawaran Bhawan(offices of environment ministry). This was to stand witness to GEAC(GM crops regulatory body) meeting on GM Mustard's approval and lodge their protest against the same. The Chairman of GEAC had to come out to face the group and accepted the demand to talk to our environment minister Shri Prakash Javadekar regarding our concerns. Shri Javadekar heard the concerns of a delegation from Sarson Satyagraha and assured that no decision will be taken on GM mustard in today’s meeting. When the delegation objected to opacity in the working of GEAC and absence of a health ministry representative, as GM concerns the health of the consumers, he promised to look into the matter and closed the meeting. So GM Mustard has been delayed, but not stopped. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our concerns are scientific and rational based on experiences of farmers and consumers across the world suffering under the weight of a failed technology which is not reversible. There is a growing number of independent scientists and research that is raising serious concerns on GM safety. We all need to fight together to ensure that the democracy wins and so does this constant struggle to keep our food safe for us and our generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solar power is paving the way for sustainable development in Uttarakhand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 1px; border: 1px solid black; vertical-align: text-top;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/85794_138072.jpg" alt="Devastated roads in Uttarakhand"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Devastated roads in Uttarakhand © Rohit Joshi&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devastating floods in Uttarakhand were a wakeup call against the unchecked urbanisation in eco-sensitive areas. The destruction was of apocalyptic proportions and the aftershock of such a disaster will be felt for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such a scenario the Indian Army is paving the way for a sustainable future by redeveloping the affected villages in a sustainable manner. Solar street lights have been installed in four villages in Rudraprayag district by the Border Security Force (BSF), which now plans to extend the benefit to seven other villages located in the Kalimath Valley. Each identified village will be allotted 20 to 30 solar lamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting from the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The move helped the villagers gain their lost confidence. Our village consists of 68 families, of which about 35 families used to abandon their houses in evening for taking night halt at some other place. After the installation of solar lights, 15 families are now staying back at night," Surendra Singh, a resident of Chaumasi village, said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"It is generally observed that whenever heavy rainfall takes place the power department cuts the supply of in remote areas. In such situations, the solar streetlights are more reliable than the general power supply. Our village too will benefit from this privilege soon," Laxman Satkari, a native of Kotma village, said.&lt;/em&gt; [1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These solar street lights are providing the villagers a sense of security and at the same time it's a message of intent from our brave soldiers who risked their lives in undertaking one of the largest rescue operations ever. The message is loud and clear 'We can only move forward by working in harmony with nature and using the resources that mother nature has bestowed upon us and not by over-exploiting these gifts from our mother.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in Delhi I see this scenario every day, where rather than making optimum use of the resources provided to us we are over-exploiting and at the same time misusing them. There are malls and corporate districts in Delhi and Gurgaon which are so well lit that it can give the sun a run for its money in terms of brightness and illumination. Conversely and rather perversely there are residential areas in Delhi where women are afraid to venture out at night due to dimly lit corridors and streets. This reminds me of a section in the critically acclaimed White Tiger by Arvind Adiga where he talks about an India of two halves, one which is in darkness and "half baked" and the other an affluent India full of illumination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's high time we merge the darkness and the light and it could only be done if we channelize the power of the sun. Being the capital of our country it is heart wrenching to see how poor urban planning is affecting our society. How about using the power of the sun to illuminate streets in our cities? If it's happening in a distant village in Uttarakhand then why not in Delhi, which receives abundant solar energy most of the year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a pledge to develop Delhi in a sustainable manner by harnessing the greatest gift nature gave us, the power of the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><subtitle>Government should support the expansion of renewable energy and not nuclear</subtitle><tags>renewables</tags><text>&lt;h2&gt;Government should support the expansion of renewable energy and not nuclear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	Chennai, 22nd October, 2012 – Greenpeace welcomes the solar policy announced by the Tamil Nadu government. The decision to generate 3000 MW of Solar Energy by 2015 and making the 6% Solar Purchase Obligation (SPO) mandatory for the high tension (HT) users like SEZ's, large industries, IT parks &amp; telecom towers is an ambitious step. Further the focus on the decentralised generation makes this policy unique and a well thought out one and must set an example for other states to follow.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;With this policy the Tamil Nadu government has provided a crucial support to solar when the state is reeling under power deficit. Apart from being clean, solar power plants take much lesser time to become operational and start generating electricity in comparison to coal and nuclear power plants. Solar prices are rapidly falling and are likely to be cost competitive with coal in the next 3 years. Nuclear energy will fail not only in terms of safety concerns, but also on the grounds of economics. Thus, it poses a valid question whether the government should focus on the expansion of coal and nuclear energy or support the expansion of renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><subtitle>Questions Delhi government on plans to face the energy crisis and it’s no show on renewables</subtitle><tags>renewables</tags><text>&lt;h2&gt;Questions Delhi government on plans to face the energy crisis and it’s no show on renewables&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	15 May, 2013, New Delhi: Greenpeace activists were today violently removed from the entrance of the Delhi power minister Haroon Yusuf's residence. The activists were peacefully protesting against Delhi's zero performance on its renewable energy targets as highlighted in the Greenpeace report "Powering Ahead with Renewables: Leaders and Laggards".
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists had blocked Haroon Yusuf's residence by placing solar panels at the entrance and chained themselves to it. The activists demanded to meet Haroon Yusuf and that he commits to a policy on renewables energising Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After persistent demand by activists, Yusuf finally agreed to meet them and accepted the solar panels but was non committal on timeline for strong policy on renewables. He did, however, agree to forward the Greenpeace report and recommendations to Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission for future action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar panels displayed a message that urged the power minister to "Switch on the Sun". The 2.3 KW panels can light up Yusuf's house meeting most of its energy demands. The activists handed over the panels to Haroon Yusuf to emphasise that he should also look at using solar to power Delhi homes and commercial establishments using their rooftops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Power Minister Haroon Yusuf has no plans to deal with the electricity crisis. Despite holding the power portfolio, he has hardly enunciated as to how he intends to deal with the gap in demand and supply of electricity in the capital. In our report we have highlighted how Delhi has completely ignored its renewable energy targets under the Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) mechanism. Meeting renewable target could have staved off the power cuts that residents in various colonies in Delhi are facing," said Anand Prabhu Pathanjali, energy campaigner, Greenpeace India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpeace report underlines the performance of all the states on their renewable energy target under the RPO mechanism. The mechanism, introduced by Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, guides state electricity regulatory bodies to set targets on renewable supply in energy mix. However the compliance under the mechanism is not mandatory and hence only 7 out of 29 states have met their targets. Delhi achieved 0.01 per cent of the target showing lack of political will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delhi's peak deficit during 2011-12 was around 77 million units along with substantial load shedding throughout the city and its suburbs, these could have been avoided if Delhi had even taken up its insignificant RPO target of 3.4 per cent seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greenpeace believes that renewable energy is the key to energy independence and access to quality electricity supply in all the areas of Delhi. The government should earnestly take steps to improve its performance on use of renewable in the national capital to deal with the increasing demand and uncertain supply from conventional sources," added Pathanjali.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><subtitle>Low-cost solar PV pumping set demonstrated in Kalyan Bigha by Greenpeace</subtitle><tags>renewables</tags><text>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	Asserting the fact that small-scale, decentralized renewable energy systems holds the key to development for rural India, Greenpeace today, demonstrated and installed a solar power pumping system at Kalyan Bigha (native village of Hon’ble Chief Minister Shri Nitish Kumar)in Bihar. It was one of those rare moments which gave insight into how renewable energy is empowering people across the country, especially rural areas.  People can get reliable energy that does not put additional pressure on our environment.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In  a state where 81% of the population is dependent on agriculture  contributing to 42% of the state domestic product, it is important that  the government takes such initiatives which will improve the  productivity without compromising on environment as well as reducing  reliance on expensive and polluting diesel. New technologies should be  encouraged to make the state self-sustaining with regards to water and  electricity. With no operational costs, the Solar PV Pump Set provides  an alternative to irrigation pump sets which run on grid electricity and  diesel and has huge operational potential in Bihar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: top; margin: 0.5px; border: 0.5px solid black;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/image/Bihar%20solar%20pump%20set.jpg" alt="Solar PV Pump set demonstration in Bihar" width="579" height="415"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Photograph: &lt;em&gt;Greenpeace/&lt;span id=":28h" dir="ltr"&gt;Paras Nath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The low cost PV pumping system offers a huge potential to increase the  agricultural productivity and will reduce the dependency on erratic  electricity supply and poor irrigation system. The Solar PV pumping  system is light weight and can be manually installed in any open well or  bore well. It delivers 1500-2000 liters of water per hour for 6-8 hours  on a sunny day. For better water management and maximum output, it is  recommended that drip irrigation method should be used. The model fits  well with Bihar State Micro-Irrigation Project (BSMIP) objective to  encourage drip and sprinkler irrigation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It  is quite apparent that a strong political will and an enabling  framework with focus on low cost solar pump set are required for Bihar's  inclusive growth. In the recently announced Agriculture Roadmap to  ensure a truly pioneering "Rainbow Revolution" would remain unfulfilled  without the focus on proper irrigation system. The state must work  towards ensuring secure irrigation system to put Bihar on world map as a  champion of Rainbow Revolution and that can be achieved only through  renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><subtitle>Bangalore join hands with the global movement against Monsanto and GMO’s</subtitle><tags>health</tags><text>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	On the eve of the World Food Day on October 15, Bangaloreans joined the global march against Monsanto for the cause of food safety and seed sovereignty in India. Almost 200 people including farmers, scientists, students and activists gathered in front of the Town Hall in the heart of the city and proclaimed their rejection of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in our food and farming and corporate control over our agriculture.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The gathering raised slogans against Genetically Modified (GM) crops and Monsanto and sang songs about the need for ecological farming. 'Monsanto go back' was a strong sentiment throughout the event and people of all ages echoed this call. Activists also performed a short street play to depict the dangers of GMO's and corporatisation of our food systems. Several activists also spoke about the current scenario with GMO's in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inaugurating the public action against Monsanto, veteran freedom fighter and Gandhian, H.S Doraiswamy urged everybody to continue the struggle to keep our food and farming free from the clutches of profit hungry multinationals like Monsanto. Reminding the gathering about our freedom movement he said, "The very cotton that Gandhiji used as a weapon for our freedom struggle against the British Raj is now totally under the control of an American multinational, Monsanto. This they did through aggressive marketing tactics of their proprietary GM Bt cotton, the only GM crop commercially cultivated in our country. After gaining total control over cotton seeds they are now aiming to get control over our food crops and that needs to be stopped at any cost."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Currently Monsanto controls 95 % of the cotton seeds in India. Their Bt cotton has failed miserably and farmer suicides have increased in regions like Maharashtra were Bt cotton was introduced. Highlighting it's massive failure in Karnataka Anekatti Vishwanath, farmer leader from Dodballapur near Bangalore said, "The Bt cotton myth has been broken. It has neither increased the yields nor has it brought down the pesticide use. All that it has done is to give the entire cotton seed market into the hands of Monsanto which has earned hundreds of crores as royalties from our farmers. The tragedy is that our own government and public sector agriculture institutions are hand in glow in this fraud."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further demanded the state government to immediately conduct an investigation into the failure of Bt cotton in the state and blacklist companies like Monsanto who have caused severe distress to poor farmers in Karnataka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 11th October 2013, the Karnataka High Court had dismissed petitions that challenged criminal prosecution of top officials of Monsanto/Mahyco and University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharward who have been accused of the egregious crime of biopiracy in promotion of Bt Brinjal, India's first GM food crop. Speaking from the event, Leo Saldanha from the Environment Support Group (ESG) which first exposed this serious crime said, "Monsanto has historically worked to take away control over seeds from local farming communities as an integral part of their business model. Now they have been caught red handed illegally appropriating brinjal varieties endemic to India and which constitute our biodiversity heritage. We will continue to closely monitor efforts of national and state biopiracy regulatory agencies to ensure the criminal proceedings against the corporation and collaborating institutions reaches its logical end."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the world, Monsanto has been removed and banned from several countries like Germany, Russia, Japan, New Zealand, France, Switzerland etc.In India, Monsanto is still vying to get complete control over our seeds and farming to maximise their profits. Neha Saigal, Sustainable Agriculture campaigner, Greenpeace India, says, "On the one hand scientific evidence on adverse impacts of GM crops on human health, environment and farm livelihoods are increasing by the day and on the other hand our central government is out on a limb to push GM crops into our farms and plates. The latest in these efforts is the Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India (BRAI) Bill which has been introduced in the last session of the parliament. The bill proposes to create a single window clearance system which is designed for easy approval of GM crops. This is nothing but a Monsanto protection and Promotion law."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is imperative that the BRAI bill is withdrawn because it will facilitate the fast track entry of GM food crops into our agriculture and lower the bar for GM crop approvals with no independent long-term studies on their safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of this year's World Food Day is 'Sustainable Food systems for food security and Nutrition'. Let's not forget that we cannot afford to leave our health and the safety of the food we eat to corporations whose only driving force is growth and profit. Sustainable agriculture can create enough healthy food for our population while also safeguarding the environment and our farmer's livelihoods. Until the government promotes sustainable agriculture over dangerous technologies like GM crops it is our responsibility to protest all across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

	On the eve of the World Food Day on October 15, Bangaloreans joined the global march against Monsanto for the cause of food safety and seed sovereignty in India. Almost 200 people including farmers, scientists, students and activists gathered in front of the Town Hall in the heart of the city and proclaimed their rejection of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in our food and farming and corporate control over our agriculture.

	New Delhi 22nd September - Greenpeace India today launched the Clean Air Nation1 movement, calling on the government to make urgent improvements to the National Air Quality Index (NAQI), as a first step towards securing what the Government has referred to as citizens' 'birthright to clean air'. Greenpeace has pointed out severe limitations to the Index as it currently stands: it is limited in its scope, lacks transparency, and above all, it is not designed to make Air Quality data widely available or useful to citizens.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“The National Air Quality Index can be a powerful tool if implemented correctly. Accurate information about the quality of air we are breathing is a crucial first step in the public campaign for clean air,” said Nandikesh Sivalingam, Campaigner, Greenpeace India, “But there is an urgent need to fix the NAQI, before it can actually deliver on its promise of providing reliable and transparent information. The Index data also needs to be used more proactively, with adequate information shared about precautionary measures that the public can take, while the authorities take action to address the root causes of air pollution.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent status check on NAQI&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; implementation by Greenpeace found discrepancies in the investment in infrastructure: only Delhi has 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; continuous monitoring stations; Chennai, Bangalore and Lucknow have three stations each; Hyderabad has two; and the 10 other cities covered by the NAQI have only one station each capable of making NAQI data available online. Additionally, even in Delhi, the NAQI data is rendered meaningless, as the current information dissemination system is unreliable, no agreed steps to be taken by local authorities on days with heavy pollution, and no plan for how the data can be used to inform citizens' fight against pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is good to expand the NAQI across the nation; indeed, that is one of our key demands,” continued Nandikesh, “But more importantly, it needs to be supported by appropriate infrastructure and a clear action plan. In its current form, the NAQI is like an alarm clock left on mute: it may or may not show the right time when you look at it, but it’s no use if you sleep right through it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent World Health Organisation study&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; listed the world’s 20 most polluted cities, with as many as 13 of these in India: a clear indication of the urgent need to act on air quality. Greenpeace also carried out an air quality monitoring survey&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; in four key locations in Bengaluru, including that of Christ College, Hosur Road and the Reserve Bank of India on Nrupathunga Road. An eight hour, real-time average of PM10 levels revealed that air pollution levels were peaking at 13 times the Indian government safety limits and 26 times that of the World Health Organisation (WHO)&lt;sup&gt; 6&lt;/sup&gt; standards during the sampling duration, with average pollution levels 1.3 and 2.5 times higher than the CPCB&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; limits in two locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising levels of air pollution have a direct impact on citizens’ health as medical professionals are witnessing. Dr. H Parmesh, Paediatric Pulmonologist, Lakeside Hospital, Bengaluru said, “In the last 15 years, summer-time asthma cases in Bangalore in the under 18 age group  has gone up by 27%, whereas the persistent and very severe asthma has increased from 4-11%. These children are on steroids and are constantly expected to be in medical care. Exposure to high levels of pollution, particularly on cold winter mornings, exercising or playing sports, makes children more susceptible to respiratory ailments."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are multiple studies linking exponential rise in the air pollution levels to premature deaths in the country. There is greater need than ever, for people to be informed about the quality of air they are inhaling, the impact on their health, and the precautionary measures needed. Clean Air Nation is an initiative to show people’s power of reclaiming their right to clean air.The Government must deliver a transparent, reliable and uniform National Air Quality Index across India, so that they can act on pollution before we reach a point of no return,” concluded Nandikesh.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><subtitle>Resident welfare association pledges their rooftop for setting up solar energy</subtitle><tags>renewables</tags><text>&lt;h2&gt;Resident welfare association pledges their rooftop for setting up solar energy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	New Delhi, 12 May 2013: To provide a solution to the intensifying energy crisis in Delhi and generate people’s support for solar energy, Greenpeace today organised “Switch on the Sun”, a renewable energy community fair in association with the Sukhdev Vihar (Pocket B) Residents Welfare Association.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The fair through exciting and interactive activities informed participants about renewable energy and how the sun can power homes through the simple but powerful idea of solar roof tops.  The fair had an informative photo exhibition, a street play, a musical performance lit up with solar energy and t-shirt painting and quiz for children. The community fair also included easy to use energy roof top audits which helped residents to calculate the cost benefits in pledging roof top space for solar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Delhi has more than 320 days of sunshine in a year and has a huge potential for solar energy that gives people the freedom to generate and use their own electricity as well as sell whatever extra is generated. But the Delhi government has paid no heed to this alternate source. In our recent report “Powering Ahead on Renewables: Leaders and Laggards”, &lt;a title="" href="#_edn1"&gt;[i]&lt;/a&gt; Delhi was amongst the worst states in terms of achieving their renewable energy targets.  It is completely dependent on coal powered plants mostly in the neighbouring states.&lt;a title="" href="#_edn2"&gt;[ii]&lt;/a&gt; If it truly wants to become a sustainable city then it has to look at clean and sustainable sources of energy,” said Usha Saxena, public engagement campaigner, Greenpeace India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RE Fair was attended by the residents of Pocket B at Sukhdev Vihar. Speaking at the community fair, Anshu Garg, president, RWA Sukhdev Vihar said, “We are very excited about using the sun and our rooftops to solve Delhi’s energy crisis.  We have pledged our rooftops for the solar energy revolution and will urge the government to promote grid interactive solar roof top energy instead of polluting and toxic waste to energy plants like the one in Okhla.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="" href="#_ednref2"&gt;[ii]&lt;/a&gt; Over 75% of Delhi’s electricity comes from coal-based thermal power plants which are mostly situated in other states. Last year, 32 major thermal power plants, including five major power plants which supply power to Delhi, faced severe coal shortage due to rising cost both in domestic and international market, leading to deficit of 8000 MW of electricity generation. On the other side electricity generation from solar and wind energy stepped up.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;1st September 2012&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only when I woke up in the morning that the feeling started sinking in. I am actually going to be spending a month in the middle of the forest!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excitement started at 2 am in the morning when almost 8 cops landed up in my hotel room, 4 in uniform and 4 in civil. They woke me up for a routine enquiry about why I was climbing up a tree in the forest. My brain took a few seconds to start functioning properly again and what followed was 45 minutes of conversation on why the forests need to saved from coal mining and why it's so important for me to occupy the forest for a month. They left smiling and asked me to drop a copy of the permission letter to the nearest police station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus began another journey to the forests, this time I knew I was going to be there for much longer. On my way to my new residence in the forests, I stopped at St Mary's school and told them about the protest. They were already aware of the issue and they pointed out to me the overburden behind their school.  They were aware about the problems coal mining causes and they supported me in my cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk from Padmapur forest check-post to the tree is about a couple of kilometers. There was a lot of support from local NGOs and media, who came to see me off. Only after every one had left by 2 pm did I have the forest to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 1px; border: 1px solid black; vertical-align: top;" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/54/57254/53784_101622.jpg" alt="Coal power plant visible from the tree house" width="603" height="452"&gt;View of the chimney of the thermal power plant from Brikesh's tree house.

&lt;p&gt;When I looked out of the tree house, my accommodation for the next one month, I realized that the problem of coal mining is literally standing at the doorstep of this beautiful forest. Three times a day the ground beneath my feet shakes because of the blasting that is being done in the Padmapur open cast mine, which is to my left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smoke from the blast slowly rises to completely cover the overburden but only for a few minutes. A little to the right I can see the chimney of the coal power plant and behind me the buffer zone of the Tadoba Andhari Tiger reserve. Unfortunately there is a lot of coal under this forest. Sooner or later when they run out of coal in the existing mines there is going to be open season in the forest behind me and I don't want that to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our government is destroying these forests in our name. They tell us, 'you need electricity', but we need to tell them that we do not want our forests to be destroyed for electricity and that's the reason why I have decided to make this forest my home for the next one month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, our country is hosting the UN Convention on Biodiversity where world leaders will be talking about plants, trees, animals, birds, forests and there could not be a better time than this to tell our leaders that the country is united when it comes to saving India's forests from destructive coal mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next one month, I will be constantly be in touch with you through tweets, blog, I will be posting on Facebook, taking lot of pictures of sightings of birds and animals so you can see what all is at stake. You will see what I see, you will feel what I feel and all I need from you is your support. Please log on to www.junglistan.org/act and sign the petition and share it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I get off that tree on September 30th I don't want to have a feeling that I am alone.  Till then hang around on our &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/greenpeaceindia?ref=ts" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; for Junglistan diaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help reach a 100,000 by October. &lt;a href="http://www.junglistan.org/act" target="_blank"&gt;Sign the petition now! &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So Delhi’s solar eclipse is finally receding. After two years of dilly-dallying and releasing a restrictive version of net-metering guidelines last November that clearly attempted to block the sun over the national capital, the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission has finally corrected its past mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the DERC released new net-metering guidelines that will play a positive role in the upscaling of solar rooftop in the national capital and will buffer Delhiites against electricity cuts and tariff-increase shocks. For a start, the fresh guidelines give a consumer complete freedom to put up any number of solar panels as his roof would allow, thus giving every Dilliwala the chance to turn into an electricity producer, managing his own little power house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the uniform and standardized net-meters, which must be brought from the power distribution companies, ensure that there is no chance to tamper with the mechanism. The added advantage that units generated can carry over in the next billing cycle ensures that every ray that falls on the panels does not go waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With coal getting expensive and power companies passing on the increased costs to consumers, Delhi has witnessed a steep 45% hike in power tariffs within the last two years alone. In June this year, when temperatures reached a sizzling 47.8 degrees Celsius, the city tripped at 5,600MW, leading to a shortage of 400MW or 2-10 hours of power cuts across the capital. Solar can thus help Delhi tide over this unending loop of power cuts and tariff hikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 300 days of uninterrupted sunshine, Delhi is solar energy’s paradise. According to a report issued by Greenpeace and Bridge to India last year, Delhi can produce 45% (2,557MW) of its peak electricity demand by tapping only 4.42% of the available rooftop area. Nearly half of this potential comes from residential buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this potential and solution to Delhi’s power woes will continue to lie waste unless the DERC and the state government help the city walk over the next hurdle: cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, a 1kW system costs around Rs 80,000-1,00,000. A 30% subsidy given by the MNRE will bring down the cost only marginally, leaving the consumers jittery of making a substantial investment. Delhi thus urgently needs a solar energy policy announcing preferential subsidies and tariffs that will make clear financial sense for Delhiites to book their roofs with solar panels. In Tamil Nadu, for example, solar rooftops picked up in popularity after the subsidy provided by the state and Centre together reduced the cost by 50%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, a solar policy would bring in time-bound targets that can get the investors and consumers moving, creating a robust, self-sustaining market. Not to mention, it can help the state fulfil its Renewable Purchase Obligation or green energy targets, in which the national capital has consistently been the worst performer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement of the net-metering guidelines comes at the right moment when there is a national focus on maximizing renewable energy to meet the country’s energy demands. The DERC and the Delhi government need to continue this momentum generated on solar rooftops by announcing the right policy with the right kind of financial incentive mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's hope that solar cells are soon integrated into the DNA of this beautiful city. Because when that happens, we can be sure that Delhi will never fall back into darkness again.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Former Chief Minister of Bihar, and eminent JDU member, Nitish Kumar interacting with senior campaigner renewable energy, Manish Ram. Nitish Kumar visited Dharnai on 4th August 2014, to see the solar microgrid set up by Greenpeace India (c) Prashant Ravi
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p class="gmail_default"&gt;The small village of Dharnai was firmly in focus today, as eminent JDU leader and former Chief Minister of Bihar, NitishKumar visited the small village to witness first hand Greenpeace's decentralised renewable energy project there. The anticipation hung thick in the air, even as people started pouring in from early afternoon to meet him and hear him speak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="gmail_default"&gt;He spent some time observing the systems installed at the local Kisanm (Farmer) Training Center. He interacted with various representatives from Greenpeace, CEED and BASIX present, after which Senior Campaigner Manish Ram showed him the instalments and explained how it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="gmail_default"&gt;He also went into the village post this, to interact with the villagers and see for himself the extent of the impact the micro grid had made to their homes. The people of Dharnai told Mr.Kumar that they have electricity for the first time in 30 years because of this project. The project has lit up one Kisan Training Centre, 50 shops, a bank and a school, few government buildings, several agricultural water pumps, 60 street lights, 450 households of 2,200 people approximately - all powered by the sun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="gmail_default"&gt;Find out more about the microgrid : &lt;a href="http://dharnailive.org/"&gt;http://dharnailive.org &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="gmail_default"&gt;Speaking to the gathering of 2000 people he spoke of how in May 2012, when he was incumbent Chief Minister of Bihar, he had met Greenpeace and requested them to demonstrate a decentralized renewable energy project that could be replicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="gmail_default"&gt;He expressed deep praise and appreciation towards Greenpeace for having accomplished this project. He said it's a great solution and needs to be worked upon to ensure that the technology grows and matures. He spoke about coal being a limited resource and renewable energy being the future - indeed the only source of power in the future - hence it's even more important that efforts be made in this direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="gmail_default"&gt;He also mentioned that it was important for the Government to expand the grid and ensure it reaches Dharnai so that the micro-grid can be integrated into it. He deeply appreciated Greenpeace's work on safeguarding the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="gmail_default"&gt;Mr.Kumar was accompanied by the State's Energy Secretary; and social scientist &amp;amp; Founder-Member Secretary of Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI) Dr.Shaibal Gupta. Their presence and comments in Dharnai today clearly shows the support that this DRE project has gained from politicians, administrators and social thinkers alike, and paves the way for it's expansion in the future. In a country where 400 million people still live without electricity, there could be no greater need of the hour.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><subtitle>Greenpeace India Launches Crowdfunding Campaign To Support Kedia's Ecological Agricultural Model</subtitle><tags>sustainable agriculture</tags><text>&lt;h2&gt;Greenpeace India Launches Crowdfunding Campaign To Support Kedia's Ecological Agricultural Model&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	13 July 2016: Kedia, Jamui district, Bihar: Farmers in Kedia village are adopting ecological agricultural practices. It's a sustainable model and steadily being known as the "Kedia model". 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace has launched a &lt;a title="https://greenpeaceindia.ketto.org/support-indias-farming-future?utm_campaign=kedia&amp;amp;utm_source=greenpeace-india&amp;amp;utm_medium=staff" href="https://greenpeaceindia.ketto.org/support-indias-farming-future?utm_campaign=kedia&amp;amp;utm_source=greenpeace-india&amp;amp;utm_medium=staff"&gt;crowdfunding model&lt;/a&gt; to help community build resilience against climate change and fluctuating market conditions, by donating towards a solar-powered cold storage unit (EcoFrost) and water harvesting structures. The call for donations is on the platform of Ketto, a third party crowdfunding website that enables projects like &lt;a title="Kedia" href="http://act.greenpeace.in/sustainable-agriculture/food-for-life/?utm_source=facebook&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=food-for-life"&gt;Kedia&lt;/a&gt; to connect India to issues at the heart of India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 40% of farm produce gets wasted due to a lack of storage space in India. A majority of our farmers are small and marginal, who cannot afford storage or water harvesting structures, even with subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a solar-powered cold storage system, Kedia farmers will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extend the shelf life of their produce and cope with market-rate fluctuations. No more exploitative prices, no more rotting vegetables!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receive higher returns on the ecologically produced food, adding to their financial security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save their own seeds (of crops like potato)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a big plus, being a solar-powered unit dependent on clean energy, the cold storage will be a truly sustainable solution to Kedia’s storage crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the solar powered storage unit: Ecofrost Technologies Private Limited have designed a pioneering and innovative micro Cold Storage- a solar powered cold storage system Ecofrost, works at zero running cost as a solution to the wastage of agricultural produce in India. The product is developed at the Science and Technology entrepreneurship Park (STEP) of IIT-Kharagpur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kedia is embarking on an ecological agriculture revolution, information on the campaign and updates can be found &lt;a title="Ketto" href="http://greenpeaceindia.ketto.org/support-indias-farming-future?utm_campaign=kedia&amp;amp;utm_source=greenpeace-india&amp;amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;amp;utm_content=post"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	Mumbai 20th March 2018| Seven climbers climbed the Vashi Bridge by pinning a banner of hope towards cleaning up Mumbai’s air. The 60 ft x 22ft foot banner said “Mumbai Clean Air Now!”. The banner on the busy Vashi bridge, which sees thousands of vehicles passing daily was to symbolise the impact of emissions from vehicles on our air quality.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, in Delhi, environmental activists from different social background held a protest outside Badarpur Power Plant which has been shut down multiple times due to pollution issue and has become symbol of fight against air pollution. The twin cities protest was to mark the solidarity and uniting people towards momentum against air pollution. Seven clean air enthusiasts showing their true grit climbed the Vashi Bridge with a message of urging to “Mumbai Clean Air Now”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The protest were for reminding the MoEF&amp;amp;CC for an immediate enforcement of the National Clean Air Program by making it public and putting sector wise plan to achieve 35% emission reduction in three years in public domain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The activities in Delhi and Mumbai are towards highlighting the impacts of one of the biggest sources of air pollution fossil fuels (coal and petroleum oil)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deven Arya, Climber &amp;amp; Activist said “when I think of impact of air pollution, how it is adversely impacting us gives me courage to stand up and be the part of Clean Air Movement. I have read situation being bad in Delhi but earlier this year also witnessed smog in Mumbai as well, I can’t imagine wearing a mask everyday at work, so I had to do something. Our state government must formulate a clean air action plan to win this battle against smog”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greenpeace India &lt;a title="report" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2018/Airpocalypse_II_29Jan18.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Airpocalypse II &lt;/a&gt;report highlighted earlier that 6.7 million children under 5 years of age live in districts exceeding the national ambient air quality standards across Maharashtra with another 2.6 million living where there is no data on the status of air quality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akshay Gupta, Campaigner, Greenpeace India said “The situation of air pollution is increasingly deteriorating in the state of Maharashtra. With only 16% of the population living in areas having availability of real time air quality data shows how casually the state is handling the air pollution crisis, leave aside the concrete action plans to reduce the hazardous air pollution levels.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fact that none of the 24 cities across Maharashtra are complying to the annual PM10 air quality standards set by CPCB should become a matter of concern before Mumbai turns into another Delhi. “Mumbai should lead by examples not on the lists of most polluted and unhealthy cities to live in, but in being the city where clean air, environment and health is prioritized. Mumbaikars must demand for transparent publicly available and robust Action Plan to reduce air pollution in alignment with National Clean Air Program but with more specific actions across sectors., concludes Akshay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Link to photographs: (Delhi &amp;amp; Mumbai)  http://media.greenpeace.org/collection/27MZIFJXMY6VY&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For further  details:&lt;br&gt;Jitendra Kumar, Senior Media Specialist, &lt;br&gt;9868167337, &lt;img class="obfimg Eoi_1" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Templates/Planet3/Styles/Images/emailimages/bb966fe6c52fe9c2e9c7d3a876a7c0ea.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Delhi 19th December 2017 |&lt;/strong&gt; Amid the National health emergency faced by India as a country due to hazardous air pollution levels Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change’s response to a question in Rajya Sabha on Monday raises hopes of breathable India in near future. Greenpeace India welcomes the National Clean Air Program (NCAP) formulated to fight air pollution crisis in India. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcoming this move by the MOEF&amp;amp;CC, Sunil Dahiya, Air Pollution Campaigner, Greenpeace India said “National Clean Air Program (NCAP) is an important first step towards ensuring clean air for India. To make it truly national, it’s important to have a measurable, focused and precise targets with clear timelines and demonstrable accountability towards public health” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Calling it as people’s victory, Dahiya further said Our reports such as “&lt;a title="Airpocalypse" href="https://secured-static.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/Airpoclypse--Not-just-Delhi--Air-in-most-Indian-cities-hazardous--Greenpeace-report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Airpocalypse&lt;/a&gt;” highlighted the need to act nationally on air pollution followed by the concrete demand for National Clean Air Action Plan through various other letters, statements, representations and reports such as “&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/eastasia/Global/eastasia/publications/reports/climate-energy/2016/Clean%20Air%20Action%20Plan,%20The%20way%20forward.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Clean Air Action Plan: The Way Forward&lt;/a&gt;” over past couple of years. Multiple other partners and organizations along with Greenpeace India coming together on the issue and raising the need for National Clean Air Action Plan across the country made it possible that the Government take steps forward to safeguard “Citizen’s right to Breathe Clean Air”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ends&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2AVQWqj" target="_blank"&gt;Photos of the coal power plants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.greenpeace.org/shoot/27MZIFJXCI9EH" target="_blank"&gt;MoEFCC protest photos&lt;/a&gt;  (*Credit Line Compulsory)&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/2017/docs/Letter_to_MOEF_Dated_7th_December_2017.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Letter shared with MOEF&amp;amp;CC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Further Details; please contact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sunil Dahiya, Senior Campaigner; Greenpeace India; &lt;img class="obfimg Eoi_1" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/Templates/Planet3/Styles/Images/emailimages/e826c1965cddb8a77b7f3ffc9898e677.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m Reema Ganguly and I work for Greenpeace India. I am Indian. I am India. Just as you are or maybe you aren’t. But what I’m about to share with you is a dream. This is my dream. I bet it is your dream too. Nothing complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memories from the past&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up In Delhi and Mumbai (Bombay, back then). Life was simple. We didn’t have the menace of plastic bags or power cuts. We had our own shopping bags. We used to drink water straight from the taps or stored in the &lt;em&gt;surahi&lt;/em&gt; (clay receptacle). We didn’t have a cooler or the rarefied air of an AC! Mangoes soaked in a bucket of water for a few hours were the perfect dessert or snack. Melons with sprinkling of sugar on top, yum!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was trust. We didn’t look suspiciously at people nor were we frisked or our bags checked. I didn’t know the word ‘terrorism’ or tsunami, for that matter. I used to wait until 9 pm to make an STD call (only when we got a phone connection) because the rates were halved. And you had to talk at the top of your voice because of a poor connection. Before that it was trudging to an STD/ISD booth. Do you remember those days? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we are better connected through multiple channels of communication. We stay cool in air-conditioned environments. We feel more secure with multiple frisking and scanning of our bodies and belongings. I can travel on the Metro and reach within minutes from one place to another. I can connect with somebody sitting thousands of miles away with a single xclick. Have we come a long way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But have we, really? I yearn for those days gone by. I don’t remember power cuts back then. My heart bleeds for the people I see in the sweltering heat on the streets. Yes, I walk in this heat too but I know I can reach my office or home and cool myself. Death due to heatstroke – can you imagine that kind of death? It’s a life gone. Is our government bothered?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My dream&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, I dream of an India where my countrymen will have plenty of food to eat, clean water to drink, clean air to breathe and unlimited electricity. Just basic needs. Am I asking for too much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, poverty is on the rise and the rich are getting greedier and more corrupt. Approximately 300 million of my countrymen are still living without power. They have no access to education or health facilities either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine our India, our world with happy people who have food on their table, clean water to drink and 24/7 electricity. Yeah I know, you’re shaking your head and saying to yourself – not possible. I feel like that too, sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;I dare to dream and in bullet points:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That our future generations won’t know the meaning of the word power cut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That every city, every town, every village will have unlimited electricity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That they won’t know the use of RO, Aquaguard, or mineral water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That they will never be short of food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That we will all be sustainably prosperous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That we will trust each other again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That India will be truly shining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my head, it’s all connected to that one unlimited source of energy – the sun. It’s like the Duracell battery, it never runs out! Can our government not see this? I am sure it can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal - dirty coal – destroying the lives of thousands of people working in the coal mines and of those living around them; and destroying forests – is not the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to get creative, we need to rise above business-as-usual, we need to realise the advantages of using our rooftops as a space to generate power. We need to come together. We need to pressurise the Delhi government to set an example for the rest of the states in harnessing the sun’s unlimited energy. We need to feel proud of our capital city, our country where we can say that our people are healthy, educated and cared for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You, I, we need to tell Sheila Dikshit that it’s time to ‘Switch on the sun’. &lt;a title="Click here" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/What-We-Do/Energy-Revolution/Delhi-can-switch-on-the-sun/No-power-cuts-for-Delhi/" target="_blank"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;India is emerging as a world leader in solar. As the third largest solar market globally&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-74cd2cab-bf7c-7c0f-364b-235c746a9a16" style="font-size: 5.7pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, a market that is growing by 90%, making the potential of solar in our country quite tremendous. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prime Minister Modi inaugurated the International Solar Alliance - an alliance of solar potential rich countries - on the first day of the UN Conference (that also delivered the world's long awaited global climate agreement aka The Paris Agreement).&lt;br&gt;So not just the market, but also the political will in the country for solar is stronger than it has ever been. However, there are several hurdles that still need to be cleared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Solar panels in Tangtse" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/136625_243970.jpg" alt="Solar panels in Tangtse"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span id="a2.2.1.1.1.4:CaptionLong_Lbl" class="Lbl"&gt;This 100 kWp stand-alone solar  plant at Tangtse, Ladakh, supplies electricity to a clinic, a school and 347 houses in this remote location, for around five hours each day.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The country's target is to achieve 100 GW of solar by 2022. Though we have increased the installed capacity of solar almost 6 times in the last 3 years, we are still at a meager 12 GW of installed capacity. Even in Delhi where &lt;a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/greenpeace-terms-delhi-govt-s-solar-policy-a-trailblazing-step-116060700907_1.html" target="_blank"&gt;Greenpeace has lobbied for a Solar Policy&lt;/a&gt; and made inputs into the Net Metering Guidelines, the uptake of rooftop solar remain disappointing. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;On the other hand - air pollution accounts for 1.2 million deaths every year according to Global Burden of Diseases. This costs India 3% of its GDP. While the state and central governments are yet to recognize air pollution as a national health emergency, it is important that citizens of India take initiative and move away from thermal power. Solar policies have already been put in place by various state governments and citizens need to shed their inhibitions and avail their benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Lodhi Gardens" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/136623_243968.jpg" alt="Lodhi Gardens"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Air pollution makes our monuments unrecogniseable&lt;br&gt;Image: Sudhanshu Malhotra/ Greenpeace&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Not only does it help lessen pollution but it also drastically reduces or even eliminates your electric bills. Whether you’re a homeowner or a large corporate hub, a school or a mall - electricity costs can make up a large portion of your monthly expenses. With a solar rooftop plant, which is a one time investment, you’ll generate free power for your system’s entire 25+ year life cycle. Even if you don’t produce 100 percent of the energy you consume, solar will reduce your utility bills and you’ll save money - especially because residential electricity prices have been going up and will continue to rise in the foreseeable future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By investing in a solar energy system now, you can protect against unpredictable increases in electricity costs. If you’re a business or homeowner with fluctuating cash flow, going solar also helps you better forecast and manage your expenses. The use of solar energy can also increase your property value.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img title="Shekar Srinivasan's home runs completely on solar" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/136622_243966.jpg" alt="Shekar Srinivasan's home runs completely on solar"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sekar Srinivasan's home in Bangalore, runs completely on solar&lt;br&gt;Image: Vivek M./ Greenpeace&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For retired Delhi resident Mr.Pankaj Rajpal (link story) it brought down his bills from 8500 INR to 1500 INR. He will recover his investment in 3-4 years and have reduced electricity bills for the next 2 decades.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greenpeace India can facilitate if you want to #GoSolar too.

&lt;p&gt;What happens when a design for a solar water pump is actually implemented?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innovation challenge ran from September to November, 2013, with three winners from across the world - Canada, Hungary and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, one of the winners of the challenge - Vivek Mundkur from Pune, India designed his solar powered irrigation pump and began with the testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's called the Atom Solar Suntrolley - it is a 1 horse power portable solar water pumping system which can replace diesel irrigation pumps for small farmers. It can deliver 10,000 litres of water per hour. The key features of the pump are - that it is portable, and can be assembled within 10 minutes anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sun-trolley offers a unique solution to farmers, who often suffer from issues which are not in their control. For example, erratic rainfall, floods and draughts can affect the crop production which forces farmers into social economic problems like farmer suicides and unending debt cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diesel is a rising cost for farmers, leading to inconsistencies in their profits. Using a portable solar irrigation pump can solve issues related to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In regions where electricity supply and distribution is unreliable, and volatile diesel costs can push communities into a complicated poverty trap, this Atom Solar-trolley is going to create a new model of irrigating farmlands in India&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;1. India signed the Cartagena Protocol* aiming to protect biodiversity and provide biosafety in 2003, but now, is keen to give the go ahead to GM Mustard (straight road to monoculture)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/135790_241974.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;Image: commentphotos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Right from the beginning GM Mustard has been shrouded in secrecy. All the pages of the GM report have not been available to the public despite the fact that the authority is bound to. The only thing made available was a summary report, for which you had to seek permission, visit the ministry mentally analyse all the pages, that too only for a short period of time in October 2016. &lt;br&gt;P.S: photography and photocopying was not allowed.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://secured-static.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/image/2017/gm-2.gif" alt="" width="400" height="224"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teen.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;3.  The GEAC’s response to 700 comments from the public on GM mustard is not to be seen anywhere, and the basis of its green signal is still not clear.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="https://secured-static.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/image/2017/gm-03.gif" alt="" width="350" height="306"&gt;&lt;br&gt;GIF: glee.wikia&lt;br&gt;GEAC (Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee)
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;4. Whoever says GM Mustard is safe, says it because there has been no safety studies done for GM Mustard or the herbicide it will be tolerant to. Not for human beings or any other living organisms. &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;address dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://secured-static.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/image/2017/Whoever-says-GM-Mustard-is-safe.gif" alt="" width="499" height="343"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-a4e3a1ab-58ac-c5fe-2451-1744e0e90f22"&gt;Media.giphy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;5. Sufficient trials and testing have not been conducted for GM Mustard. Should the government then just let farmers test this unscientific claim on their fields?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;address&gt;&lt;img src="https://secured-static.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/image/2017/gm-4.png" alt="" width="458" height="408"&gt;&lt;br&gt;image:imgflip.com&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;6. There are already many varieties of non-GM hybrids that have shown better productivity than GM Mustard and the Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) knows that well. But has the GEAC considered them before GM Mustard?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;address&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://secured-static.greenpeace.org/india/Global/india/image/2017/gm-5.gif" alt="" width="500" height="376"&gt;&lt;br&gt;GIF: i.imgur&lt;br&gt;MoeFCC- Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;7. One argument that you are bound to hear is - GM Mustard should be introduced to cut down on import prices. But GM Mustard does not improve productivity, so it is unlikely that it will cut down on import prices. What is necessary, however, is raising the current import prices. We need to ensure there are import tariffs to prevent cheap imported oil from flooding the Indian market and encouraging farmers to grow oil instead!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/community_images/0/535500/136177_242891.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;8. Should India become a dustbin for this potentially dangerous GM technology when Europe and Russia and other countries have strongly opposed it?.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Approving GM even after knowing the facts is like making Indians lab rats in an irresponsible and irreversible experiment. So Greenpeace India says that GE technology in agriculture is poor science with money-grabbing motives. Too little is known, public authorities are in too much of a hurry and too little information is given to the public for assessment. Government regulations on GE technology are too weak and so we must be alert and cautious to this potentially dangerous situation. Better safe than sorry.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<item><subtitle>Celebrating the adoption of Greenpeace India’s 2GW solar energy vision in the Solar Policy released by Delhi Government yesterday</subtitle><tags>renewables</tags><text>&lt;h2&gt;Celebrating the adoption of Greenpeace India’s 2GW solar energy vision in the Solar Policy released by Delhi Government yesterday&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	New Delhi | 7th June 2016| Delhi got its much awaited solar policy on Monday. The Delhi government unveiled and approved the solar policy in the cabinet meeting.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Pujarini Sen, Campaigner Greenpeace India said &lt;em&gt;“This is a great victory for our people powered campaign: Switch on the Sun. We were the first to put forward a 2GW vision for Delhi, through our report: Rooftop Revolution &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[1].&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;This is a trailblazing step towards fulfilling India’s global climate commitments, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious national solar targets, and overall sustainable development. If the entire country moved in this direction, then the long overdue Energy Revolution in India will be achieved soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace India along with thousands of its supporters played an active role in the adoption of the new solar policy by the Delhi government. The NGO lobbied with the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission for the release of Net Metering guidelines &lt;strong&gt;[2],&lt;/strong&gt; and been closely involved with the Delhi Dialogue Commission, alongside other stakeholders, in drafting the Solar Policy released yesterday. “Thousands of our supporters have helped us convince the government of Delhi’s readiness to usher in a rooftop solar revolution. We engaged with multiple allies, partners and volunteers including resident welfare associations (RWAs) and other institutions such as, hospitals, hotels, government establishments,” said Sen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URJA, the apex body of RWA in Delhi, an active partner in Greenpeace’s Switch on the Sun campaign, also welcomed the Solar Policy announced by the Delhi Government and its ambition to make Delhi a Solar City.  “Indeed with its high potential of solar incidence and massive power consumption, Delhi is well suited to take the lead among metropolises in this direction,” said Ashutosh Dikshit, CEO URJA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have helped the RWA community in five colonies across Delhi to install the solar power panels in their offices. With this new policy, we are confident that we will be able to facilitate many more installations, making use of various policy provisions like Generation Based Subsidy and Virtual Net Metering. We hope to make big advances in implementing solar power generation, and continue to be engaged, alongside Greenpeace, in creating awareness in Delhi,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace believes this is a step in the right direction and with this announcement, Delhi can leave behind its &lt;em&gt;previously embarrassing label of ‘worst performance in meeting renewable purchase obligation targets &lt;strong&gt;[3]&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and truly be a leader by implementing the policy and contribute to meeting India’s national renewable energy targets.&lt;/p&gt;
